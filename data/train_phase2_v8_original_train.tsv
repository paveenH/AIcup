1133	1628	A & B.  Specimens A and B show similar histopathologicalfeatures. The gastric tumour is a 120mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST is adherent to and expands themuscularis propria and has a lobulated appearance. The tumour is variably moderately to highly cellular and is composed of plump to moderately atypical spindled cells arranged in interweaving fascicles with areas of nuclear palisading. In areas, the tumour cells show moderate cytologic atypia, including nuclear enlargement, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Foci of myxoid degeneration, haemorrhage and oedema are present throughout the tumour. Mitoses are present, with up to 49 mitoses per 50 high power fields. A focus of possible incipient tumour associated necrosis isseen. The tumour appears clear of the gastric resection margin. Although much of the tumour largely surrounded by a thin rim of fibrous tissue and some attenuated muscularis propria, focally the tumour extends to the inked (serosal) surface. There is no involvement of the overlying gastric submucosa or mucosa, which shows features of a patchy mild non-specific chronic gastritis.	PHI:Null

1133	3145	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1133	3154	The gastric tumour shows morphologic and immunohistochemical features consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours greater than 100mm in size and with a high mitotic rate (greater than 10/50hpf), are typically associated with a high risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM). This tumour shows variably prominent moderate nuclear pleomorphism, which is of uncertain clinical significance, as cytologic atypia is not a reliable predictor of tumour behaviour in these tumours.

An unremarkable appendix 60mm in length is also identified. Within the caecum, and involving the ileocaecal valve, is a circumferential ulcerated tumour, 60mm in maximum dimension. The proximal margin is 45mm from the tumour. The tumour invades through the muscularis propria at the ileocaecal valve, and into adipose tissue, to a maximum depth of 20mm.  Overlying the tumour atthe caecum, is an attached roughened area of muscle. Sectioning through the tumour shows a tan cut surface with invasion through muscularis propria into the overlying adherent abdominal wall tissue, where it comes close to the margin.  The colonic mucosa distal to the tumour appears markedly thinned and several diverticula are noted.  One 5mm polyp is also identified within the distal colon.

1141	365	Specimen labelled "Cholecystectomy plus liver resection", consists of a segment of liver, 60 x 60 x 55mm, with attached gallbladder 78mm long and 39mm in diameter at the fundus, and a small amount of fat attached to the gallbladder 50 x 45 x 10mm, together weighing 101g.  The gallbladder has been opened prior to receipt.  The liver resection margin is inked black.  The mucosa in the neck region and in most of the fundus appears unremarkable and the wall is 1-2mm in thickness.  However a firm masswith a granular surface is noted in the body, resulting in severe narrowing of the lumen. The serosal surface shows puckering in this area with fibroadipose tissue adhesions.  Sectioning through the tumour shows a circumferential, firm, irregular, off white tumour measuring approximately 33 x 30 x 17mm.  The tumour involves the full thickness of the gallbladder wall and appears to infiltrate the attached fat as well.  The tumour shows sharp borders with the underlying liver and is at least 7mm from the liver resection margin.  The liver appears macroscopically unremarkable.  No lymph nodes are identified.	PHI:Null

1141	1854	Sections show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of gallbladder.  This appears to be of biliary type.  There is some gland formation but much of the tumour consists of solid cords and trabeculae of cells.  The tumour cells have medium sized and large, vesicular nuclei and amoderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumour invades through the gallbladder wall and extends into adherent fat.  It extends to just beneath the serosal surface of the gallbladder and adherent fat.  It also focally invades into the attached liver segment but the hepatic resection margin is well clear.

The entire anterior surface is covered by serosa and the anterior peritoneal reflection is not seen.  The pericolic fat appears complete.  A circumferential poorly circumscribed tumour is identified 45mm from the distal resection margin.  The tumour is 33mm in length, 37mm in width and appears to infiltrate the full thickness of bowel and probably invading the pericolonic fat. The tumour is up to 14mm in thickness.  The pericolic fat is at least 16mm inthickness around the tumour and the tumour appears 15mm from radial resection margin. Several uncomplicated diverticula are identified in the adjacent bowel wall.  No polyps or additional lesions are seen.	PHI:Null

1159	9086	The primary tumour is a WHO grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, however in several of the metastases (specimens D and E) the mitotic count is up to30/50hpf and the Ki67 stains up to 40% of tumour cells. Nuclear pleomorphism is also more pronounced within these areas. Therefore, there appears to be a component of high grade tumour (WHO grade 3) within the metastatic foci. Even withinthese high grade foci, Ki67 expression is still highly variable between different areas.	PHI:Null

1164	2280	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr F Zermeno):	DOCTOR:F Zermeno
1164	2321	Sections show a dedifferentiated liposarcoma, 135mm in maximum dimension. The subfascial tumour has a multinodular configuration and shows a predominantly abrupt transition from well differentiated lipoma-like and sclerosing liposarcoma to dedifferentiated myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma (myxoid MFH)-like areas. The skin and subcutis are uninvolved.  The transition between the well and dedifferentiated components is generally abrupt, however, focal intermingled areas (block 13) are also noted.  Although most of the tumour is well demarcated by a fibrous pseudocapsule and/or adjacent atrophic muscle, well differentiated tumour infiltrates skeletal muscle superficially and laterally (blocks5 &13).  The moderately cellular dedifferentiated component (approximately 60% of the tumour) is composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells with hyperchromatic, often angulated nuclei, occasionally prominent eosinophilic nucleoli and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm, some with intracytoplasmic hyaline globules. The pleomorphic tumour cells are arranged in a storiform pattern and haphazardly.  The stroma of the dedifferentiated component is fibromxyoid and contains a supporting capillary-like vasculature which focally appears plexiform and there is patchy mild associated chronic inflammation.   In the latter areas, the tumour shows features superficially resembling myxoid liposarcoma, however, the degree of nuclear atypia and association with a well differentiated liposarcoma component excludes that diagnosis.  The dedifferentiated component shows broad areas (estimated 40% of the total tumour volume) of therapy-related coagulative necrosis.  Mitoses are generally inconspicuous but, in the most proliferative areas, number up to 4 per 10 HPF including atypical forms.  Within the well differentiated areas, enlarged hyperchromatic angulated stromal cells and multivacuolated lipoblasts are easily identified.  Focally fibrous scar tissue and foreign body type giant cells are noted adjacent to tumour.  The dedifferentiated component of the tumour shows similar histological features to the previous incisional biopsy (21I76240).	IDNUM:21I76240
1164	4529		PHI:Null
1164	4533	Close to the superficialmargin moderately cellular pleomorphic dedifferentiated tumour merges with less cellular, less pleomorphic mitotically active atypical spindled and stellate ganglion-like cells. The latter component, favoured to represent dedifferentiated tumour over a reactive proliferation of myofibroblasts, infiltrates skeletal muscle and reaches the inked resection margin. The superficial margin is therefore regarded as suspicious for involvement by sarcoma. The remaining margins aredetailed below.	PHI:Null

1169	144	Specimen labelled "Right posterior liver resection", consists of a piece of liver measuring 70 x 60 x 30mm. The surgical margin isragged and haemorrhagic.  The serosal surface is dusky and smooth. The surgical margin is inked.  On section, there is a subcapsular white and solid tumour measuring 40 x 25 x 23mm.  It is located 12mm from the surgical margin. The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  Blocks 1-4 - representative sections from the tumour; 5 - 1 representative section of non-tumoral liver; 6 - tissue selected for tissue banking.  (QA/ec 25.9.62)	DOCTOR:QA++DATE:25.9.62
1169	710	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr B Montane)	DOCTOR:B Montane
1169	751	The sections show metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal adenocarcinoma.  The lesion is about 3mm from the resection margin and reaches close to the liver capsule.  The uninvolved liver shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis and moderate chronic inflammation in the portal tracts.  The tumour cells express CDX2 and keratin 20 antigens by the immunoperoxidase method.  Keratin 7 antigen is expressed in biliary cells and some adjacent hepatocytes but not in the tumour cells. The immunophenotype is consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.	PHI:Null

1186	3687	The sample was analysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]).  Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation.  This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater.

1186	4218	The p. Val600Glu (V600E) mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was detected, which indicates that this tumour is unlikely to be sensitive to EGFR inhibitors.	PHI:Null
1186	4375	Comments	PHI:Null
1186	4384	BRAF mutations are found in 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1.2].  V600E specific BRAF inhibitors (e.g. Vemurafenib) have been developed to inhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients.  Trials of Vemurafenib have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3].  The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [4].	PHI:Null

1186	5629	Summary:	PHI:Null
1186	5638	The somatic BRAF mutation V600E was PRESENT in tumour DNA from this patient. This finding indicates that methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter may be present but should be interpreted in association with other laboratory and clinical findings.	PHI:Null

1186	5919	Clinical details: cancer	PHI:Null
1186	5944	Background:	PHI:Null
1186	5956	Absence of MLH1 gene expression in a tumour can be due to heritable or somatic mutations in the MLH1 gene. Heritable mutations cause hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) whereas somatic mutations cause non-familial cancers. A common type of somatic mutation involving the MLH1 gene is epigenetic silencing due to methylation of the promoter; epigenetic mutations are rarely familial. Hence the loss of MLH1 gene expression due to promoter	PHI:Null
1186	6428	methylation makes if very unlikely that the patient has a heritable mutation in the MLH1 gene.	PHI:Null
1186	6523	A specific somatic mutation in the BRAF gene, c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu or V600E), is a useful surrogate marker for methylation of the MLH1 promoter in tumour tissue. The absence of the V600E mutation in tumour tissue is strongly associated (>95%) with absence of methylation of the MLH1 promoter. Absence of the V600E mutation is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, HNPCC.	PHI:Null
1186	6898	The presence of the V600E mutation is associated (75%) with methylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of the V600E mutation indicates that HNPCC is unlikely but does not exclude other familial cancer syndromes.	PHI:Null
1186	7114	Method:	PHI:Null
1186	7122	Mutation testing is performed on DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. A region including nucleotide 1799 is amplified by PCR and the presence of the T>Amutation is determined by a single nucleotide primer extension assay. This assay will detect a mutation that is present in 5% or more of cells tested.	PHI:Null

1203	9166	The primary tumour is a WHO grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, however in several of the metastases (specimens D and E) the mitotic count is up to 30/50hpf and the Ki67 stains up to 40% of tumour cells. Nuclear pleomorphism is also more pronounced within these areas. Therefore, there appears to be a component of high grade tumour (WHO grade 3) within the metastatic foci. Even within these high grade foci, Ki67 expression is still highly variable between different areas.	PHI:Null

1226	3635	MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION	PHI:Null
1226	3659	Examination of multiple transverse sections through the parapharyngeal mass show a large, circumscribed, multilobulated tumour which is surrounded in part by a compressed fibrous connective tissue pseudocapsule.  The capsule contains residual salivary gland ducts with associated fibrosis and collections of chronic inflammatory cells.  The tumour exhibits a varied morphologic pattern with cellular areas alternating with loose, myxoid and chondromyxoid stroma.  In addition central areas of marked stromal hyalinisation are identified. The cellular areas contain sheets of myoepithelial cells withinterspersed ductal structures.  The ducts exhibit a biphasic arrangement with inner ductal cells and abluminal myoepithelial cells.  The myxoid areas contain spindled, stellate as well as plasmacytoid appearing myoepithelial cells.  The myoepithelial cells have large, vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Mild nuclear pleomorphism and occasional mitoses are noted.  Focally necrosis is observed with associated granulation tissue and fibrosis.	PHI:Null
1226	4709	The tumour abuts the soft tissue plane of excision focally.  In addition, focal intravascular tumour is noted within the fibrous capsule.	PHI:Null
1226	4848	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1226	4857	Atypical pleomorphic adenomas exhibit some features that raise concern about the potentialbiologic behaviour; however these features are insufficient on their own to attest malignancy.  These include intravascular tumour in small vessels in or adjacent to the capsule as well as cytologic atypia.	PHI:Null

1227	562	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr N Dewald):	DOCTOR:N Dewald
1227	605	Sections show liver tissue with a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.  This has a lobular outline and consists of thick trabeculae of cells with large, highly pleomorphic nuclei and generally abundant bright eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Many of the nuclei have a single, prominent nucleolus.  The tumour is quite well circumscribed.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The tumour extends to just beneath the overlying liver capsule but the capsule is intact.  The liver resection margin is free of tumour.  The tumour is 5mm from the margin of the closest point.	PHI:Null
1227	1190	Liver tissue immediately adjacent to the tumour shows prominent fibrosis, replacing virtually all the parenchyma.  Sections of liver tissue away from the tumour show an irregular cavity which contains inspissated bile and has surrounding dense fibrous tissue; this is consistent with a previous surgical or tumour ablation site.	PHI:Null
1227	1521	Some better preserved liver tissue is alsoseen away from the tumour.  This shows fibrous expansion of portal tracts and some fibrous bands but reasonably intact architecture, without obvious cirrhosis.  There is a moderate infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes, in portal tracts and fibrous bands.  There is mild, focal piecemeal necrosis.  There is mild, patchy microvesicular steatosis.  There is no increase in stainable iron or copper, no Alpha 1 antitrypsin globules are seen and an Orceinstain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative.	PHI:Null

1242	1956	A.  Sections of the ovarian tumour show extensive haemorrhage and necrosis.  Remaining intact tumour is composed mainly of cells with large, highly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, oftenone or more nucleoli, and a moderate amount of clear or basophilic cytoplasm.  These cells are in solid groups and also from prominent loose, interconnected spaces (reticular pattern).  Eosinophilic globules are identified in the cytoplasm of many tumour cells.  In some of the tumour there are spaces lined by more regular columnar or cuboidal cells.  Schiller-Duval bodies are identified in one section (block A18).

1255	1901	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1255	1910	The omental, descending colon and subumbilical nodules are foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma. In the appropriate clinical context, the overall morphology (including focal squamoid differentiation) and pattern of immunohistochemical staining, would be in keepin with metastatic (grade 3) endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. No previous pathology is directly available for comparison. However, given the ER and PR, as well as, focal TTF-1 positivity, the possibility of metastatic breast or lung carcinoma, cannot be entirely excluded.	PHI:Null

1269	616	Specimen labelled "Pelvic sarcoma; short stitch superficial, long stitch lateral, double stitch deep" consists of a solid mass with three marking stitches as described on the specimen label.  It measures 85mm (lateral to medial) x 110mm (superior to inferior) x 85mm (superficial to deep).  The external iliac artery (90mm long) and the external iliac vein (70mm long) are present at the deep/medial edge of the specimen. The mass has a partial peritoneal surface over the superior/superficial aspect, the peritoneum measuring 85 x 60mm.  There is patchy fatty tissue adherent to the external surface of the mass.  Inferiorly a groove is identified, consistent with the site of the inguinal ligament.  The margins are inked in four colours: superficial red, lateral blue, deep black and medial green. The specimen is serially sliced from superior to inferior. The mass has a fish-flesh/mucoid lobulated cut surface.  It is encircling the artery and abutting the vein.  It abuts allperipheral margins.

1269	2549	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr E Shaak):	DOCTOR:E Shaak
1269	2587	Sections of the tumour show a relatively uniform appearance throughout.  It is moderately cellular and consists of spindle-shaped cells in a mainly myxoid stroma.  The tumour cells have medium-sized and large, moderately pleomorphic nuclei and wispy eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There are occasional multinucleate tumour cells.  Nuclear chromatin is rather bland but some nuclei have a single prominent nucleolus.  Mitoses number up to around 6/10 HPF.The tumour cells are arranged in short, haphazard fascicles.  No differentiating features are seen with routine staining.	PHI:Null
1269	3157	The tumour has an infiltrative appearance, invading fat at the periphery (eg. blocks 6, 7).  There are patches of lymphocytes in the tumour, consistent with tumour obliteration of previous lymph nodes.  Tumour is confirmed to completelysurround the external iliac vein and it replaces the vein wall (blocks 11, 12).  It also partly surrounds the vas deferens near the top end of the specimen (block 12).  Tumour is also confirmed to partially surround the external iliac artery, but the artery wall is intact.

1269	5053	Cytogenetics has shownstructural abnormalities of various chromosomes, and marker chromosomes with unknown chromosome content.  FISH was preformed to investigate the possibility of gene amplification in the marker chromosomes.  Amplification of the distal DDIT3 probe and MDM2 was detected.  FUS was not rearranged.  This pattern of amplification is most consistent with a diagnosis of well differentiated/ dedifferentiated liposarcoma.	PHI:Null
1269	5490	The histology has therefore been reviewed.On review it is now considered that there is abnormal fat around the main spindle cell tumour; this fat has scattered atypical spindle cells in fibrous septa.  Some of this abnormal fat is seen in association with the vas deferens.  It is now considered that the tumour is a dedifferentiated liposarcoma which has arisen in a well differentiated lipoma-like and sclerosing liposarcoma, probably of the spermatic cord.  Thededifferentiated component extends to excision margins, as noted above.	DATE:now++DATE:now

1279	3557	MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:	PHI:Null
1279	3582	Examination of multiple sections through the right parotid gland confirm the presence of the major serous gland in which there is prominent fatty infiltration. The glandular parenchyma shows multiple periductal aggregates of chronic inflammatory cells which are composed of lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells. Intervening fibrovascular connective tissue septae are present which contain dilated collecting ducts and neurovascular bundles. Surrounding fibro-fatty connective tissue and non-ganglionated nerve fibres are identified.	PHI:Null
1279	4120	Within the substance of the gland, an infiltrative tumour is identified which exhibits a varied histomorphologic pattern with lobular, microcystic, follicular and cystic spaces being noted. The individual tumour cells are large, polygonal and have finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with large oval nuclei showing prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are observed. Prominent cytoplasmic vacuolation is also identified. Special stains confirm the presence of very occasional diastase resistant granules within cell cytoplasm of occasional tumour cells and abundant mucicarmine positive secretion. The larger tumour follicles contain eosinophilic secretion with peripheral scalloping being identified. Tumour cells have entrapped nerve fibres of varying size with focal perineural infiltration being observed (block 5) Focally, a large cystic area is noted which is lined by large, hobnail appearing cells which have vacuolated cytoplasm. Interspersed areas of necrosis with associated inflammatory cells are identified and the intervening stroma shows variable hyalinisation.	PHI:Null

1279	5635	COMMENT	PHI:Null
1279	5643	The differential diagnosis considered includes a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of salivary gland origin (MASC) and acinic cell carcinoma. Prior to the categorisationof MASC as a separate diagnostic entity by Skalova et al in 2010, this tumour would most likely have been categorised as an acinic cell carcinoma. In view of the presence of positive staining for GCDFP-15 + mammaglobin, a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma is favoured. It appears thus far from limited evidence that the biologic behaviour of MASC is very similar to acinic cell adenocarcinoma, and if one is interpreted as the other, it probably has no implications for therapy or prognosis.

1286	3346	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Akles):	DOCTOR:S Akles
1286	3385	A. Sections of the right adnexal mass show a poorly differentiated carcinoma with a variable architectural pattern.  Most of the tumour is composed of sheets of highly pleomorphic neoplastic cells traversed by hyalinised fibrovascular septa.  Insular and trabecular patterns of growth were also seen.  In addition, there are areas within the tumour which exhibit gland-like microspaces which often contain mucin.  Cytologically, the neoplastic cells show marked pleomorphism with enlarged vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli.  Scattered tumour giant cells as well as large cells with bizarre hyperchromatic nuclei are also seen.  Mitoses and apoptotic cells are present but extensivenecrosis is not a prominent feature. Lymphovascular invasion is identified.  The lining of the cyst wall consists of multilayered epithelium composed of neoplastic cells with similar cytological features as that of the more solid areas.	PHI:Null
1286	4313	The features are of a poorly differentiated Mullerian carcinoma which is difficult to classify.  Some areas have features most in keeping with poorly differentiated serous carcinoma, there are also areas resembling poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma, and there is some mucin production.

1303	3267	Morphological Description	PHI:Null
1303	3293	Sectionsshow a circumferential ulcerated moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within the rectum.  The tumour is composed of scattered, often widely separated, small tubular malignant glands or more complex glandular structures which invade through the muscularis propria reaching the interface of the expanded fibrotic subserosa with mesentery.  No single cell invasion is seen.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  Anteriorly, in an area presumably covered by serosa (mesothelial layer denuded) the tumour extends close to but does not penetrate the presumed serosal surface and there is associated organising haemorrhage but no adhesions are seen.  The ulcerated area of mucosa shows no residual carcinoma but there are adjacent foci of atypical mucosal glands including definite focal high grade dysplasia within the confines of the tumour.  There is a mild response to neoadjuvant therapy with moderate stromal fibrosis and a patchygiant cell reaction to foci of dystrophic calcification (the latter almost abutting the presumed serosal surface); these changes are limited to the rectal wall with no significant stromal alteration within the mesorectum.  Other features of radiotherapy effect include hyaline alteration of vessel walls and intimal foamy histiocytes.  The non-neoplastic mucosa shows patchy chronic architectural disorder with irregular and branched crypts.  No basal plasmacytosis or granulomas are seen and the crypt architectural changes may relate to therapy induced chronic ulceration.	PHI:Null

1306	1562	The 22mm left breast lesion is a well circumscribed, unencapsulated fibroadenoma. The fibroadenoma is composed of ducts with a mixed pericanalicular and intracanalicular pattern surrounded by variably fibromyxoid stroma. Focally, some of the ducts within the fibroadenoma show changes consistent with atypical lobular hyperplasia/lobular carcinoma in situ (ALH/LCIS), focal epithelial hyperplasia and squamoid metaplasia. The fibroadenoma extends to the inked/diathermied margins in areas (superior and deep margins). Foci of ALH/LCIS appear clear of margins (2.5mm from the superior margin and 6.0mm from the deep margin). The adjacent breast tissue shows changes of a recent biopsy site, focal epithelial hyperplasia, numerous dilated ducts and focal benign micro-calcification.

1315	1509	A.  The 45mm tumour is an invasive non-mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma displays a mixed lepidic (70%) and acinar growth (30%) pattern the latter comprising angulated glands within a cellular chronically inflamed stroma, mainly around or within an area of subpleural scarring and elastosis. The crowded moderately pleomorphic tumour cells display enlarged elongated grooved nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli, occasional intranuclear inclusions and eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm. Focally sebaceous-like features are present with cytoplasmic microvacuolation.  A minor component shows mucinousdifferentiation, highlighted with dPAS staining (block A5).  In several foci lepidic tumour shows continuity with ciliated respiratory epithelium.  The carcinoma abuts but does not penetrate the elastic layer of the pleura (PL0) (highlighted with orcein stains) and there is associated pleural retraction and foci of mild mesothelial hyperplasia.  The vascular and bronchial resection margins are uninvolved and well clear (40mm-macroscopic) of tumour. The stapled resectionmargin is also clear (20mm-macroscopic).  One peribronchial lymph node shows reactive sinus histiocytosis with anthracosis but no evidence of malignancy. The subpleural scar contains dilated bronchioles consistent with broncioloectasis.Away from the tumour, apart from a focus of reactive type 2 metaplasia and scattered intraalveolar macrophages, the lung parenchyma is unremarkable.

1322	1585	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Laflamme):	DOCTOR:D Laflamme
1322	1627	A.   Sections show liver tissue. The described nodule is circumscribed and surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule. Within the nodule there are a few thin fibrous bands and the hepatic architecture is somewhat distorted.  There is some bile duct- like differentiation of hepatocytes at the edges of the fibrous bands but no definite true bile ducts are identified. The hepatocytes within the nodule have very mildly enlarged nuclei but the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio is low. There is no significant nuclear atypia and no mitoses are identified.  A reticulin stain shows a fairly orderly reticulin pattern and no significant thickening of the hepatic plates.  A CD34 immunostain shows that much of the nodule is positive but there are patchy areas which fail to stain.  The appearances are considered to be most in keeping with a hepatic adenoma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  The slides have also been viewed by Prof D Rainone.	DOCTOR:D Rainone
1322	2562	The liver elsewhere shows intact architecture. There are mild, patchy infiltrates of chronic inflammatory cells in the portal tracts.  There is no significant expansion of portal tracts and no fibrous bands are seen.  Bile ducts are normal. There is mild, patchy macrovesicular steatosis.  Central veinsare normal. Occasional PASD positive globules are identified within occasional hepatocytes but an Alpha-1-antitrypsin immunostain is interpreted as negative.  An Orcein stain for hepatitis B surface antigen is negative. A rhodanine stainfor copper is negative. A perl stain for iron shows a mild patchy increase in iron staining of hepatocytes, grade 2+ out of 4. The changes in the liver away from the tumour are mild and are non-specific.	PHI:Null
1322	3308	B.   Sections showliver tissue. The described subcapsular nodule is surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule and is completely necrotic.

1332	2100	A.  The sentinel lymph node show several depositsof metastatic pleomorphic lobular carcinoma (E Cadherin negative) measuring up to 5.5mm in maximum dimension.  There are two foci of extranodal extension extending up to 0.4mm beyond the lymph node capsule over a front of 4mm. The deposit is CAM5.2 positive.	PHI:Null
1332	2408	B. Sections show a 35mm grade 3 infiltrating mixed ductal and lobular carcinoma. The tumour is centred at 12 o'clock 20mm FN but invades around the large subareolar ducts of the nipple and reaches the dermis of the nipple. The latter comprises a 5.5mm contiguous expansion of tumour rather than a satellite nodule.  No skin ulceration, dermal lymphovascular invasion or Pagetoid epidermal involvement is seen.	PHI:Null
1332	2821	Approximately 70%of the tumour shows classic lobular carcinoma morphology composed of moderately pleomorphic tumour cells arranged in solid nests and infiltrating cords.  About 20% of the lobular carcinoma component shows pleomorphic lobular carcinoma features. The latter cells display abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with occasional intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles, enlarged pleomorphic nuclei, vesicular chromatin and conspicuous nucleoli.   Approximately 30% of the carcinoma shows definite morphological ductal differentiation and these areas are both separate and intermingle with the lobular component (Block B1).  Interestingly the E Cadherin stain is negative in both the lobular and ductal components.	PHI:Null
1332	3534	Only one (1) lymph node is identified  in the left lower axillary adipose tissue and (Block B16) it contains metastatic pleomorphic  lobular carcinoma 0.7mm on the H& E stained section but >2mm in a deeper level examined with AE/AE3 keratin immunostain.  There is a focus of extranodal extension 0.25mm beyond the lymph node capsule. The lymph node has a rather monotonous appearance with indistinct follicles and mostly a diffuse arrangement of small lymphocytes.  The sinuses appearpatent and there is possible focal extranodal extension of lymphocytes.  Immunohistochemical stains indicate that most cells are CD3 and CD5 positive T cells, including the possible extranodal component. The T cells infiltrate atreticfollicles which are seen through the node, the latter marked by CD21, CD23, CD10 and CD20.  The bcl2 immunostain corresponds to the T cell component with no definite coexpression by CD20 positive B cells.  Cyclin D1 is negative.  The appearances are interpreted as reactive.	PHI:Null

1334	1807	A  The 8mm (two consecutive slices) tumour within the inferior pole is a microinvasive follicular-patterned nodule with an associatedthin capsule.  The follicles are lined by enlarged cuboidal to low columnar lining follicular epithelial cells which display round to oval, slightly crowded nuclei  with variable chromatin pallor, occasional nuclear grooves and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No intranuclear inclusions are seen.  The follicles contain hypereosinophilic colloid with some peripheral scalloping.  Focal Hurthle cell differentiation is present.  Several foci of intracapsular and two foci of transcapsular penetration are present but no lymphovascular invasion is seen.  No mitoses, trabecular architecture, necrosis or significant nuclear pleomorphism is seen.  With immunohistochemistry both the background benign follicular epithelial cells and tumour cells stain with CK19 while HBME1 highlights the tumour cells only  The surrounding parenchyma is non-nodular and shows mild to focally moderate lymphocytic thyroiditis with occasional germinal centres.

1334	2973	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1334	2982	The nodule is a minimally invasive well differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  The differential is between a minimally invasive (capsule only) follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and minimally invasive follicular carcinoma, the distinction depending on the interpretation of the nuclear features.  Despite the presence of dense colloid and peripheral scalloping,in my opinion the nuclear features both qualitatively and quantitatively fall short of definite papillary carcinoma and I favour a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma.  Immunohistochemistry is unhelpful in this distinction as boththe tumour cells and background benign follicles stain diffusely with CK19.  Lack of vascular invasion in minimally invasive follicular carcinomas portends a very good prognosis with predicted behaviour akin to a diagnosis of follicularadenoma.  .  There is focal disruption of the surgical margin due to frozen section sampling but in complete full face sections the nodule is 1mm clear with intervening thyroid parenchyma and pseudocapsule.  I will seek a second opinionfrom Prof L Onorati at MEDIC/SURGERY WARD Pathology NEWMAN HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued.

1334	6545	Reported by A/Prof L Yessios	DOCTOR:L Yessios
1334	6574	Firstly I agree that the 12mm tumour in the right lobe is a definite papillary carcinoma. Definite metastatic carcinoma is present in one of four perithyroidal nodes adjacent to the right lobe.  In the central neck dissection one node containing psammoma bodies is present (in the presence of a definite papillary carcinoma in the thyroid, I would normally classify this node as being involved by carcinoma). Therefore metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma is present in 2 of 10 lymph nodes from the thyroid.	PHI:Null
1334	7085	The 8mm lesion in the left lobe is difficult to classify.  The issue in my mind is whether it is an adenoma or adenomatous nodule or a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion (both are almost always cured after excision alone).  Therefore in the setting of a patient with a definite 12mm papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right lobe (and 2 lymph node metastases) this distinction is essentially arbitrary and certainly of no clinical consequence.	PHI:Null
1334	7570	Based on the paraffin slides I would have classified the 8mm lesion as an adenomatous nodule.  However in the frozen section side itself there is an area of capsular irregularity which at the time of frozen I would probably have classified as full thickness invasion.  On this basis I think it is best to classify the 8mm lesion as a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion.	PHI:Null
1334	7982	SUMMARY:	PHI:Null
1334	7992	Thyroid: Papillary carcinoma 12mm.  Minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion 8mm. Metastatic papillary carcinoma in 2 of 10 lymph nodes.	PHI:Null

1340	387	A.  Specimen labelled "Left kidney", consists of a kidney weighing 351.8g and measuring 130mm superior to inferior x 70mm medial to lateral x 70mm superficial to deep. The attached ureter measures 70mm in length and 5mm in maximumdiameter.  The kidney is covered with perinephric fat and has a complete capsule.  There is a large nodular mass in the posterior mid kidney abutting the perinephric fat, but not disrupting the renal capsule.  On sectioning there is a well circumscribed encapsulated nodular tan tumour measuring 57 x 50 x 50 mm.  The tumour has necrotic and haemorrhagic areas. The tumour abuts the hilum and renal capsule posteriorly.The rest of the renal parenchyma appears unremarkable.  The perinephric fat has two possible lymph nodes.  Representative in 10 blocks; 1- ureteric margin; 2- vascular margin; 3 & 4- tumour, posterior capsule and perinephric fat (closest capsule margin); 5 & 6 - paired blocks tumour and hilar region (closest hilar margin); 7 & 8 - representative tumour; 9 - normal renal parenchyma; 10 - two hilar ?lymph nodes.	PHI:Null
1340	1452	B.  Specimen labelled "Pylolymph", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue encasing one lymph node measuring 15 x 8 x 5mm.  Specimen TAE 2 blocks.	PHI:Null

1340	1693	Position of tumour: Mid left kidney	PHI:Null
1340	1729	Dimensions of tumour: 57 x 50 x 50 mm	PHI:Null
1340	1767	Tumour type: The carcinoma has a polymorphous pattern and consists of areas resembling clear cell carcinoma admixed with foci demonstrating a papillary architecture. In many areas the tumour displays an alveolar-like growth pattern and the tumour cells contain abundant granular and clear cytoplasm.	PHI:Null
1340	2067	These changes, in combination with the patient's age, suggest that this carcinoma is an Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma.	PHI:Null

1340	2307	Rhabdoid differentiation: Absent - Although many of the tumour cells have voluminous eosinophilic cytoplasm, no diagnostic evidence of high grade rhabdoid differentiation is seen.	PHI:Null
1340	2487	Necrosis: Present (20 - 25%)	PHI:Null
1340	2516	Tumour spread beyond kidney: The carcinoma is bounded by a thin fibrous capsule which is focally disrupted posteriorly (block 3). Deeper levels have been examined and no definite invasion of perinephric fat is identified.	PHI:Null
1340	2738	Tumour extends beyond Gerota's fascia: No	PHI:Null
1340	2780	Tumour in renal sinus fat: No.  There is a circumscribed nodule of tumour which bulges into therenal sinus fat, bounded by fibrous tissue. (block 5). Staging is difficult as some authors regard only direct tumour invasion between adipocytes to represent invasion of renal sinus fat. Because of this, the tumour is considered pT1b rather than pT3a.	PHI:Null
1340	3128	LVI is identified in this region (see below).	PHI:Null
1340	3174	Tumour in renal vein or its segmental (muscle containing) branches: No. The sections of the vascular margin are clear of tumour.	PHI:Null

1347	4286	One abnormal metaphase was detected, with abnormalities including a large marker derived from chromosome 12.  FISH testingwith MDM2 showed a signal pattern consistent with MDM2 gene amplification in the majority of the interphase cells.

In addition, there is a 1mm focus where atypical glands are back to back consistent with a tiny residual focus of grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (block 33). The endometrioid carcinoma appears confined to the endometrium. There is no invasion of myometrium. No lymphovascular space invasion is seen. There is no involvement of the otherwise unremarkable cervix. The endometrium also shows patchy progestational changes with cystic atrophy and patchy mild chronic endometritis. There is widespread myometrial adenomyosis. The right fallopian tube shows a focus of endometriosis. The left fallopian tube and bilateral ovaries show no significant histologic abnormality.	PHI:Null

1362	1876	The terminal ileum shows no abnormality.  A total of twenty-five polyps have been identified in the extended right colon and all of these polyps are either tubular adenomas or tubulovillous adenomas.  The larger polyps are tubulovillous adenomas which tend to be pedunculated.  The degree of dysplasia is generally low grade with one focus of high grade dysplasia.  All of the polyps have been totally blocked and no invasive carcinoma is identified.  The ileal and colonic resection margins appear normal and the colonic mucosa away from the polyps shows no abnormality.  The appendix shows an area of diffuse mucosal hyperplasia and there is a small inflamed diverticulum at the tip of the appendix.	PHI:Null

In the area of the tumour several uncomplicated diverticulum are unremarkable.  Several further diverticulum are identified in the remainder of the colon.  No othersuspicious areas are identified.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the mesenteric fat.

1398	1120	Sections show a high grade malignant spindle cell neoplasm, which is highly cellular with marked cytological and nuclear pleomorphism.  These cells areadmixed with bizarre tumour giant cells and chronic inflammatory cells.  A storiform pattern and myxoid changes are focally present.  There are large areas of tumour necrosis.  No low grade or well differentiated areas are seen.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for CD34.  The stains for CD117, MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin), SMA, Desmin and S-100 are negative.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is 15%.  The overall appearances are consistent with those of undifferentiated high grade sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma).  Because of the positive stain for CD34, the possibility of malignant extrapleural solitary fibrous tumour cannot be excluded.  The overlying colonic mucosa is unremarkable.

1404	1915	A.  The right lobe of thyroid has been completely embedded and shows a non-encapsulated 32mmpapillary carcinoma (8 consecutive slices). The carcinoma displays a mixed papillary and follicular architecture within a hyalinised, sclerosed stroma.  In areas the tumour shows Hurthle cell features. There are scattered foci of associated psammomatous calcification. No solid/insular or trabecular architecture is seen and there is no necrosis.  Mitoses are inconspicuous.	PHI:Null
1404	2384	There are several foci of extrathyroidal extension into perithyroid adipose tissue andstriated muscle, approximately 0.9mm beyond the thyroid; in areas the boundaries of the thyroid are difficult to define because of replacement by sclerotic tumour stroma.  No definite vascular or perineural invasion is seen.   The tumouris less than 0.1mm from the posterior/tracheal margin (A4 L3), separated by a thin layer of fibrous tissue, and 0.2mm from the anterolateral margin (A2) separated by striated muscle, in an area in which the muscle appears disrupted.

1407	711	Specimen labelled "Radical distal pancreatectomy" consists of a tail of pancreas attached to spleen and a piece of omentum.  The omentum measures 170 x 30 x 5mm and appears macroscopically unremarkable.  The spleen measures 130 x 100 x 30mm.The external appearance and cut surfaces of the spleen are unremarkable.  The tail of the pancreas is markedly expanded by a tumour mass and measures 120 x 70 x 60mm.  It has a multinodular external surface and is partly covered by adipose tissue.  Multiple enlarged lymph nodes are identified.  Macroscopically the tumour is 25mm from the pancreatic resection margin.  The superior margin is inked red, the inferior margin is inked green, the anterior margin is inked blue and the posterior margin is inked black.  The pancreas is serially sectioned from the pancreatic margin (slice 1) to the splenic hilum (slice 15).  On sectioning there is a large irregular poorly defined solid tumour with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.  The tumour abuts the anterior and inferior margins.

1407	2273	Sections show a cellular tumour.  The tumour cells are in sheets and trabeculae and have medium sized and large, vesicular nuclei and generally scanty basophilic cytoplasm.  Many of the nuclei have one or more small nucleoli.  There are occasional ribbons of cells but no gland formation or other definite differentiating features are seen.  There is prominent, patchy tumour necrosis and mitoses are frequent.  Tumour is seen extensively infiltrating residual normal pancreas and also invades intoextra-pancreatic fat and other soft tissue.  Lymphovascular invasion by tumour is identified at least focally.  Tumour surrounds nerves within and adjacent to the tail of pancreas but no definite perineural invasion is identified.  Residual tail of pancreas distal to the tumour is atrophic.	PHI:Null

1413	207	Specimen labelled "Sigmoid colon" consists of a segment of large bowel measuring 180mm in length x 40mm in maximum diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny.  The previous polypectomy site is identified on the mucosa; this measures 3 x 4mm and is 50mm from one surgical margin inked black and 120mm from the opposite surgical margin inked blue.  There are two other small mucosal polyps, each 2mm diameter.  A small diverticulum is also noted near one resection margin.  Otherwise the mucosal surface appears unremarkable.  Only a small number of lymph nodes are found in the mesentery despite careful and repeated searching.  Representative in 16 blocks.	PHI:Null

1415	472	Specimen labelled "Extended hemicolectomy with partial stomach and partial liver" consists of a segment of small and large bowel (450mm long), mesenteric fat (up to 110mm across), an adherent part of stomach (70mm in length, and an adherent part of liver (80 x 30 x 27mm).  The adherent stomach is 50mm from the closer colonic cut end.  The hepatic resection margin is inked green after removing the staples.  There is an indurated tumour involving the wall of the large bowel 73mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour infiltrates through the mesenteric fat and appears to be abutting the serosa and theadherent wall of stomach.  It is 70mm from the closer colonic resection margin and well clear of the opposite resection margin.  The lumen of the colon is narrowed but is not occluded.  The gastric mucosa appears grossly normal.  The tumour is circumferential and shows mucoid areas in approximately 80% of the cut surface.	PHI:Null

The carcinoma is mainly intramucosal, however, there is focal extension into the superficial submucosa associated with stromal desmoplasia.  Assessment of submucosal extension is difficult due to loss of the muscularis mucosae in this area (highlighted with a desmin immunostain), however, the contour of the tumour extends below the adjacent muscularis mucosa and tumour nests are present immediately adjacent to medium sized vessels consistent with submucosal invasion.

1437	2004	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr I Motzer)	DOCTOR:I Motzer
1437	2043	A.  The entire right lobe has been embedded and examined. The 40mm nodule is a circumscribed, unencapsulated, hyperplastic nodule with a microfollicular and solid nested architecture.  The nodule is composed of follicular epithelial cells showing mild atypia with nuclear enlargement, scattered nuclear grooves and some loss of polarity, however, the features are insufficient for a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma. There are areas of central hyaline fibrosis and possible ischaemic type infarction with possible cell ghosts and dystrophic calcification.  No significant mitotic activity or nuclear convolutions are seen. Immunostains demonstrate thyroglobulin expression and negative staining for calcitonin, chromogranin and CEA. There is also anincidental unencapsulated focus of papillary microcarcinoma (A12), distributed across 1.8mm with a mixed follicular and papillary architecture.  The papillary microcarcinoma is 3.5mm clear of the clearest (posterior/tracheal) resection margin.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. Away from the dominant nodule the thyroid shows scattered unencapsulated smallfollicular nodules containing macrofollicles and mild lymphocytic thyroiditis with occasional germinal centre formation. Some perithyroidal arteries show calcification of the internal elastic lamina.  One (1) normal parathyroid gland is also present.	PHI:Null

1441	2133	A & B.  Sections show a 220mm, fungating, ulcerated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma is arranged in dissecting sheets and solid nests with associated stromal desmoplasia and extensive necrosis.  No well formed tubules are seen.  The carcinoma extensively ulcerates skin, destroying the nipple areolar complex, replaces much of the breast tissue and infiltrates skeletal muscle reaching the deep margin. The mitotically active tumour cells have large pleomorphic nucleoli, irregular nuclear membranes, vesicular chromatin and eosinophilic macronucleoli. Although in areas the tumour has asquamoid appearance, no intercellular prickles or keratinisation indicative of squamous differentiation are seen, and dPAS stains highlight scattered glandular lumina both betweenand within cells consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The small amount of sampled residual breast lobules show no evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).   Numerous foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen within the dermis (A2), breast and extranodal tissue of the axilla. The tumour extends to the superficial, radial and deep resection margins.	PHI:Null
1441	3290	Approximately seventeen of twenty one (17/21) axillary lymph nodes contain metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with similar appearances to the breast tumour.

1441	4090	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1441	4099	The morphology of the currentbreast tumour and axillary metastasis match those of the previously excised left breast tumour (core biopsy - 80V36805) and left axillary lymph node metastasis (excision biopsy - 80V36805).	IDNUM:80V36805++IDNUM:80V36805
1441	4319	A lung primary was suggested as the site of origin of the previously sampled left axillary metastasis based on the reported immunoprofile (80V36805 - CK7 positive, CK20 positive, TTF1 positive, ER negative).  The previously sampled left breast tumour (80V36805), in a more limited sample, was CK7 positive, TTF1 minimally positive, CK20 positive, ER positive (approximately 30% predominantly moderate intensity) and PR negative.  The current breast tumour specimen and axillary metastasis show similar positive immunoexpression for CK7, CK20 and TTF1.  The ER results in the current specimens are conflicting; the breast tumour is ER negative (tested twice with appropriate controls) and the axillary metastases ER positive.

1468	850	C.  Specimen labelled "Left breast" consists of a mastectomy received unorientated measuring 180mm (medial to lateral) x 170mm (inferior to superior) x 40mm (superficial to deep).  There is overlying ellipse of skin measuring 116mm (medial to lateral) x 7mm (inferior to superior).  The nipple is located on one side of the ellipse, this is presumed the inferior aspect of the skin and the breast isorientated as such.  The nipple areola complex measures 30 x 30mm.  The nipple appears slightly retracted.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin black.  In the 1to 2 o'clock position 45mm from the nipple there is a firm cream poorly circumscribed lesion measuring 40mm (medial to lateral) x 18mm (inferior to superior) x 23mm (superficial to deep).  The distance from margins is as follows.  Deep margin - 4mm, superior-superficial margin - 18mm, inferior, medial, lateral margins are well clear.	PHI:Null

1474	430	A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast tissue suture medial"consists of a right mastectomy weighing 794g and measuring 195mm (medial to lateral) x 160mm (superior to inferior) x 42mm (superficial to deep).  There is an ellipse of skin on the superficial surface of the specimen measuring 195 x 82mm.  On the ellipse of skin, there is nipple areola complex over an area of 30 x 30mm.  There are two firm tan tumours identified.  Tumour one is retro areola and measures 32 x 20 x 40mm.  The tumour is 15mm from the superficial margin, 25mm from the deep margin, 50mm from the superficial margin, 20mm from the inferior margin, 50mm from the medial margin and 75mm from the lateral margin. The cut surface is firm and tan with a nodular architecture.  Tumour two is 15mm from the retro areola tumour laterally and measures 30 x 15 x 15mm.  The tumour is 22mm from the superficial margin, 10mm from the deep margin, 60mm from the superior margin, 55mm from the inferior margin, 15mm from the lateral margin and 145mm from the medial margin.  Tumour two is firm, nodular and has a small satellite nodule measuring 5 x 5 x 3mm associated with the main tumour.  The rest of the breast tissue is fibrofatty.  The superficial margin is inked blue and the deep margin inked black.	PHI:Null

1481	1900	This tumour mass was attached to the serosa of the small bowel and had a smooth surface. My recollection is that is did not involve the small bowel mesentery (but I cant be sure of this) and the specimen has since been discarded.  It appears that there is no other structure attached to this mass and the small bowel resection margins werewell clear.  It is likely that the surgical margins are clear of the tumour".	PHI:Null

1499	526	MACROSCOPIC:	PHI:Null
1499	539	A.  Specimen labelled "Sarcoma left arm, short superior, longlateral, double radial head, loop olecranon" consists of an ellipse of skin measuring 160 x 100mm to a depth of 30mm.  There are four marking sutures in situ as described (orientated by Dr Elias ZABAWA, surgical registrar).  The deep margin includes skeletal muscle and fascia. The deep surfaces reveals a tumour which appears to be composed of two nodules.  Located closest to the superior margin is an exposed nodule in which the overlying fascia has been surgically divided. This nodule measures 45 x 40mm and is located 12mm from the medial margin and 40mm from the superior margin. There is a second nodule which is palpable beneath the skeletal muscle margin measuring 55 x 55mm and is located 4mm from the medial margin and 25mm from the inferior margin.  The lateral marginis inked blue, medial margin black, exposed tumour face inked yellow, radial head inked red and olecranoninked green.	DOCTOR:Elias ZABAWA
1499	1501	On sectioning the tumour appears well clear of the superficial margin (>50mm) and well clear of the lateral margin (> 30mm). The tumour appears to abut the medial margin.  Nodules one and two appear to be a continuous single tumour.  The tumour is approximately 35% myxoid (slices five to slices eight), 30% solid and fleshy (slices 9-11) and 35% soft cream and necrotic (slices 12-16).  The radial head margin is located in slices 8-10, the olecranon margin is located in slices 7-11.	PHI:Null

1499	2842	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr C Vanalstin)	DOCTOR:C Vanalstin
1499	2885	The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sectionsshow a pleomorphic high grade undifferentiated sarcoma nearing approximately 95mm in maximum dimension. The tumour is centred within the deep subcutis, penetrates fascia and infiltrates skeletal muscle (eg block 27) in several areas. Thedermis is uninvolved.  The tumour has a partly infiltrative and partly circumscribed profile with relatively hypocellular areas associated with myxoid stroma and more cellular areasdisplaying storiform or fascicular growth within a fibrous stroma.  The tumour is composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindled, stellate and epithelioid cells within a variably fibrous or myxoid stroma. There are capillary sizedvessels, some of which are thick walled.  There are numerous admixed tumour giant cells with hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei, many of which have intranuclear inclusions and eosinophilic macronuclei.  In some areas the tumour cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm imparting a rhabdoid-like appearance.   The adipose tissue away from the advancing front of tumour is mature with no significant variation in size and no lipoblasts identified.  The morphological appearances are similar to those of the previous core biopsy (15W55938), in which no specific line of differentiation was identified (Negative for S100, HMB45, MelanA, PANCK, AE1/AE3, SMA, Desmin).  Myogenin immunostaining is also negative. Thetumour remains mitotically active (4 per 10 HPF).  There is minimal response to therapy with only minimal necrosis (block 37) and focal areas of acute and subacute haemorrhage.	IDNUM:15W55938

1500	3281	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Amin):	DOCTOR:H Amin
1500	3318	A.  Sections of the ovary show involvement by a poorly differentiated carcinoma most consistent with poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  The tumour consists mainly of trabeculae of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm.  Some scattered tumour cells have very large, highly atypical nuclei.  Mitoses are frequent.  Part of the tumour has a prominent associated infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells.  There is some fibrofat adherent to the outer surface of the ovary and tumour extends into some of this tissue.  There is gland formation identified focally within the trabeculae of tumour cells and there is some patchy tumour necrosis.  No tumour is identified on the surface of the ovary.	PHI:Null

1501	566	MACROSCOPIC:	PHI:Null
1501	579	Specimen labelled "Intra-abdominal sarcoma (received fresh)" consists of a large fibrofatty myxoid lobular mass with adherent omentum weighing 2.63kg and measuring 210 x 200 x 100mm.  The specimen is divided for cytogenetics and 2 imprints done (sent to THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL's Hospital).  There are two areas adherent omentum, the larger area measures 180 x 50 x 30mm.  The smaller area measures 80 x 70 x 25mm.  Both areas of omentum are nodular and have discreet round encapsulated nodules of tumour within them.  The tumour is well circumscribed and partly encapsulated.  On sectioning the tumour shows a smoothglistening myxoid surface with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.  On one surface of the tumour next to the largest area of adherent omentum there is a stapled margin measuring 55mm (inked blue)? muscle.  Included with the specimen are several well circumscribed nodules of tumour measuring from 5mm to 55mm in maximum dimension.	HOSPITAL:THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL
1501	1525	Blocks:  1 to 21 representative tumour (blocks 8 and 9 blue surgical margins); 22 and 23 -representative of adherent omentum and nodules (block 22 larger omentum block 23 smaller omentum); 24 to 33- representative of smaller nodules.	PHI:Null

1501	1815	Sections show a myxoid liposarcoma (grade 1).  The tumour shows prominent myxoid stroma with a branching, plexiform (chicken-wire) capillary vasculature.  Scattered univacuolated (signet ring) lipoblasts are present.  No definite necrosis is seen and mitotic activityis rare.  Round cell areas are focally present and are less than 5% of total area sampled.  Therefore the tumour scores grade 1.  A piece of liver tissue is seen adherent to the tumour (block 11).  The tumour is incompletely excised.  The radial resection margin comprises a thin rim of compressed fibrous tissue (pseudocapsule) and tumour is seen extending to this margin over a broad area.  There is no evidence of dedifferentiation.	PHI:Null

1514	1555	A.  Sections show ovary which is enlarged and replaced by metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  This consists of small irregular cystic spaces and some glands.  The glands and cysts are lined by crowded epithelial cells with pleomorphic nuclei.  There is prominent mucin production but no definite necrosis is seen.

1526	1486	Sections show a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  Around 60%of the tumour sampled has features of a well differentiated liposarcoma, both lipoma-like and sclerosing types.  Around 40% of the tumour sampled shows features of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  This consists of moderately cellular spindle cell tumour.  The spindle cells generally show only mild atypia and are haphazardly arranged in short fascicles.  However there are scattered more atypical mononuclear and multinucleate tumour cells and there are scattered mitosesidentified, including abnormal forms.  The background stroma in the dedifferentiated component is rather myxoid.  Some infarct-like necrosis is noted in dedifferentiated and sclerosing components but this is not prominent.  Some dense fibrosis, patchy metaplsatic ossification and focal calcification are noted within the well differentiated component.	PHI:Null

The malignant cells have highly pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, variably prominent rhabdoid eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent cherry-pink nucleoli. Scattered bizarre bi and multinucleated tumour cells are also present. In areas, the tumour cells are separated by variably thick hyalinised fibrocollagenous-type septae. The sarcoma shows brisk mitotic active, with over 70 mitoses per 10 hpf, including abundant atypical mitoses. Focal lymphovascular space and perineural invasion are seen (block 1). There are broad areas of serpiginous, suppurative necrosis throughout the entire tumour (involving >50% - ?treatment related). No cytoplasmic pigment, malignant osteoid or chondroid differentiation is identified. The overlying skin shows reactive change and an organising dermocutaneous abscess, possibly related to previous surgery. At the deep and peripheral aspects, the sarcoma is surrounded by a variably thick cuff of mature fibroadipose tissue and portions of skeletal muscle, with areas of fat necrosis and a patchy myofibroblastic proliferation. A single epithelioid granuloma is present within the skeletal muscle (stains for organisms are negative). Sections through the axillary vein margin show numerous medium sized vessels, as well as, variably dense fibrocollagenous tissue. A small amount of lymphoid tissue is present at the edge of the tumour focally, and may represent an effaced lymph node. Two intact lymph nodes are also present in the surrounding fat, both of which show mild reactive changes.	PHI:Null

1548	2491	Approximately 90% of the 250mm tumour is well differentiated liposarcoma.  The remaining 10% (one of the demarcated nodules described grossly) comprises grade de-differentiated liposarcoma, 90mm in maximum dimension and present inferiorly within the specimen.  The second well demarcated myxoid nodule, at the superior end of the specimen comprises well differentiated liposarcoma with sclerosing and myxoid areas. The well differentiated areas shows lipoma-like, sclerosing and inflammatory morphology.  There are interspersed areas with myxoid stromal alteration and non-plexiform capillary like vasculature.  Well differentiated liposarcoma encases the rightadrenal gland and right kidney and extends into the renal hilum merging with renal hilar fat. The inferiorly located dedifferentiated nodule is composed of moderately cellular tumour composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindle and stellate cells, as well as, scattered bizarre multinucleated giant cells. Mitoses are easily identified.  No necrosis is seen.  No heterologous differentiation is seen.	PHI:Null

1553	364	Specimen labelled "Right colon" consists of a right hemicolectomy with appendix and attached terminal ileum.  The caecum and appendix have been opened longitudinally prior toreceipt at the laboratory.  The terminal ileum is 100mm in length x 20 x 15mm in maximum diameter.  The caecum and ascending colon are 90mm in length x 60 x 30mm in maximum dimension.  The serosa surrounding the appendix is dull and congested, elsewhere the serosa appears normal.  The appendix is 65mm in length and 10 x 8mm in maximum dimension and there is attached mesoappendix up to 70mm wide.  In the distal appendix there is a mucinous mass; this measures 25mm longby 15mm wide and is 30mm from the proximal end of the appendix at the closest point.  The mucinous mass appears to involve the full thickness of the appendix wall and appears to extend directly into the attached mesoappendix.  Several lymph nodes are identified in the mesocolon..

1553	1815	The whole appendix has been blocked.  Sections of the abnormal area show distensionof the appendix by mucus, with associated marked attenuation of some of the appendix wall.  Mucus tracks into part of the appendix wall, almost reaching the subserosal fat.  No mucus is seenextending into mesenteric fat or to the serosal surface.  The mucus in the appendix lumen is partly calcified.	PHI:Null
1553	2201	In the abnormal area the appendiceal mucosa is replaced by abnormal mucinous epithelium.  This shows low grade dysplasia with nuclear enlargement and variable crowding.  Some of the abnormal mucosa also has featuresof a sessile serrated adenoma.  Focally there is some abnormal epithelium, associated with mucus which has dissected into the inner appendix wall.  No abnormal epithelium is seen extending through the wall and no invasive carcinoma is seen.	PHI:Null
1553	2659	The features are of low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  If mucus with associated abnormal epithelium has previously escaped into the peritoneal cavity then there is some risk of the later development of pseudomyxoma peritonei.  However, on the basis of the evidence in this specimen, the risk in this case would seem to be low.	PHI:Null

1555	1949	A - C.  Specimens A, B and C show similar histopathological features. The left upper thigh and retroperitoneal lesions are mildly cellular myxoid tumours composed of bland to stellate cells, within a predominantly myxoid stroma. Very occasional cells show very mild nuclear enlargement, nuclear inclusions and hyperchromasia. Scattered thin fibrous septae, as wellas, acellular mucin lakes and ganglion-like cysts, are present. There are also numerous small thin walled blood vessels, but no "chicken-wire" or "curvilinear" vessels are identified. There is no significant mitotic activity or necrosis. The tumours are partially surrounded by a fibrous pseudo-capsule, as well as, a cuff of focally atrophic skeletal muscle and mature fibroadipose tissue. Focally, myxoid tumour dissects between skeletal muscle fibres and adipocytes and is present at the inked surgical margins. Nolipoblasts are identified. The sections of deep margin of left thigh contain myxoid tumour which extends widely to the surgical margin.	PHI:Null
1555	2967	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1555	2976	The left upper thigh and retroperitoneal (psoas) lesions are myxoid lesions with morphologic features consistent with intramuscular mxyoma(s). Theappearance is similar to that of the previously described left groin/thigh myxoma (50V95819).	IDNUM:50V95819
1555	3217	Local recurrence of intramuscular myxomas is unusual and raises the pathologic differential diagnosis of a low grade myxoid sarcoma, such as: low grade fibromyxoid tumour and myxoid liposarcoma. However, the overall morphology, including low cellularity, absence of lipoblasts and curvilinear/chicken wire vessels, makes these differentials less likely. However, if requested, FISH testing could help to exclude a low grade sarcoma (FUS - fibromyxoid sarcoma; DDIT3 - myxoid liposarcoma).	PHI:Null

1557	3798	A.  Sections show  a poorly differentiated carcinoma of cervix with areas of well formed glands, areas with a glassy cell carcinoma-like appearance, and also very focal squamous differentiation.  The tumour consists of sheets and trabeculae of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei, often a single prominent nucleolus and a moderate amount of amphophilic or pale cytoplasm.  There is a dense inflammatory infiltrate, consisting mainly of eosinophils but also with some lymphocytes and plasma cells, within and around the tumour.  The tumour is considered to be best classified as a form of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma but with some glassy cell features.  It invades deeply into cervical stroma.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion is11mm where total stromal thickness is 19mm.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  The ectocervical excision margin is well clear; the closest ectocervical margin is around 14mm.  Focal adenocarcinoma in situ is identified in the cervix (block A9) and there is also focal HPV effect and CIN3 (block A7).  No definite tumour extension into the lower uterine segment is seen.

1567	4500	Immunohistochemistry of cancer tissues for mismatch repair proteins is a surrogate marker for MSI status, with an absence of one or more of the mismatch repair proteins considered an abnormal result.  Tumours that show loss of MMR proteins are almost always characterised by microsatellite instability (MSI-H).   MSI in endometrial (and colorectal) cancer results from defective DNA MMR, either due to germline-inactivating DNA MMR mutations (Lynch syndrome patients), or epigenetic inactivation of the MLH1 gene by promoterhypermethylation (sporadic tumors).   Approximately 20% to 30% of endometrial carcinomas have microsatellite instability, and an epigenetic (sporadic) cause of MSI is more common than Lynch syndrome.  Correlation with family history and other findings recommended.	PHI:Null

In most areas of the tumour there is no myoinvasionhowever there is invasion into the myometrium in left cornu sections. This is associated with adenomyosis in this area and adenocarcinoma partly colonises adenomyosis. However the deeper parts of the tumour have rounded sheets of tumour without stroma and this is considered invasive rather than adenomyosis.

1584	2427	A.  Residual appendix stump tissue was not identified. There is extensive involvement of all peritoneal organs by mucinous neoplasm (pseudomyxoma peritonei).  The mucinous neoplasm is of moderate cellularity with epithelium surrounding or present within most rounded nodules of mucin.  The epithelium shows moderate grade nuclear atypia. The epithelium has mainly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cells have oval to columnar nuclei with nuclear grooves and irregularitty and there are atypical larger nuclei present. The mucinous neoplasm involves surface of small bowel, colon, gallbladder, spleen, peritoneum, omentum, and a thin strip of liver in one piece. The volume of tumour is moderately extensive.

1584	3617	Comment:	PHI:Null
1584	3626	A binary scheme has been proposed for grading appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei, with all tumours with significant spreadbeyond right lower quadrant (bona fide pseudomyxoma) termed mucinous carcinoma peritonei (low grade versus high grade). This low/high grade stratification is similar to Ronnett scheme and WHO.  Tumours with intermediate or hybrid features (PMCA-Intermediate -Ronnett) are grouped with low grade tumours in the Bradley scheme in view of similar behaviour in their series, and in a later series (Chua 2012), but less favourable behaviour was described in the earlier Ronnettseries for this intermediate group.	PHI:Null
1584	4256	This type of tumour would generally but not exclusively be of appendix origin. From the sections available from the previous appendicectomy from 19/12/2060, although there is a small mucosal probable adenomatous lesion presentin one of the sections (see separate review), it would be difficult to definitely conclude that this was the primary lesion histologically. The peritoneal mucinous neoplasm epithelium is more eosinophilic and not very similar to the smallatypical focus in the appendix. Clinical correlation recommended.	DATE:19/12/2060

1625	2612	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr A Mcaskill)	DOCTOR:A Mcaskill
1625	2653	A.  The 45mm right kidney tumour is a conventional clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The carcinoma has alobulated appearance and is composed of sheets and nodules of carcinoma cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei, variably prominent nucleoli and clear cytoplasm. The tumour cellsare arranged in solid and trabecular patterns and are surrounded by a prominent anastomosing network of blood vessels. Although the nuclei show predominantly Fuhrman grade 3 features, in areas, there is spindle cell (sarcomatoid) change, consistent with an overall Fuhrman grade 4tumour. At the superior pole of the kidney, carcinoma infiltrates through the renal capsule into perinephric adipose tissue and is seen 0.3mm from the inked perinephric fat margin. Focally, carcinoma extends beyond the perinephric fat and into a cuff of overlying partially adherent liver tissue. Tumour within the liver tissue appears clear of the surrounding inked hepatic surgical margins (>5.5mm).	PHI:Null
1625	3618	At the hilum, tumour nodules abut hilar fat. Tumour is present within the lumen of the renal vein and appears partially incorporated into the renal vein wall. Tumour is not present in the section of the renal vein margin, renal artery margin or ureteric margin. The adjacent non-neoplastic renal parenchymashows patchy glomerulosclerosis and mild chronic inflammation. The adrenal gland appears within normal histologic limits and shows no involvement by carcinoma.	PHI:Null

1702	1176	A, B.  Sections show pieces of tumour tissue and a small amount of adjacent gliotic brain tissue.  The tumour consists of lobules and ribbons of stratified squamous epithelium which focally includes a few mucin containing goblet cells.  The squamous epithelium sits on a loose fibrous stroma.  Within the sheets and lobules of epithelium there are loose reticular areas consistent with stellate reticulum.  Some palisading is seen at the base of the epithelium but this is not particularly prominent.  There is focal calcification.  Some pieces of tumour have a somewhat papillary architecture.  There is no necrosis and there is no cytologic atypia or evidence of malignancy.  There is a moderate, patchy infiltrate of mixed chronic inflammatory cells in part of the stroma.  The appearances are of a craniopharyngioma.	PHI:Null

1702	2151	Ki-67:  Manyepithelial basal cells positive.  Very few positive cells elsewhere.	PHI:Null
1702	2234	I favour this to be an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma rather than a papillary craniopharyngioma.  This is mainly due to the presence of definite stellate reticulum in the tumour.	PHI:Null
1702	2419	DIAGNOSIS:	PHI:Null

1702	2523	A BRAF immunostain has been performed and the tumour cells show positive cytoplasmic staining.	PHI:Null
1702	2618	This case was reviewed by Dr Q Musso, neuropathologist, at the neurosurgical pathology review meeting on 8.12.64.	DOCTOR:Q Musso++DATE:8.12.64
1702	2733	There are several features which do not fit for adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma in this case, including the lack of wet keratin, the only focal calcification, the demonstration of some mucous containing goblet cells, and the lack of a surrounding xanthomatous tissue reaction.  Also, there is no aberrant nuclear staining for beta catenin and there is now positive BRAF staining.	DATE:now
1702	3116	Overall, he favours this being a papillary craniopharyngioma rather than the adamantinomatous type.  This is still WHO grade 1.	PHI:Null

1705	522	Sections show pieces of brain tissue which include cortex, a small amount of white matter and some meningeal tissue.  Some satellitosis of neurones by cells with small round nuclei is noted but this can be normal, particularly in the temporal lobe.  There is infiltration by a small number of scattered cells with small, elongated nuclei; these cells stain CD68 positive, consistent with activated microglial cells.  At least two of the pieces appear to include the edge of the previous surgical cavity; adjacent to this there are reactive astrocytes with associated gliotic tissue.

1705	1646	I note that in the previous excision specimen in 2061 (DICKINSON 2 NORTH Pathology number 818540-31TH) the recurrent tumour was favoured to be a gemistocytic astrocytoma, WHO grade 2, and stained IDH1 positive.  There are gemistocytes around the previous surgical cavity in the present specimen but these are interpreted as reactive, although a small number of tumour cells could also be present.  The lack of staining of the present specimen for IDH1 is further support for the lack of definite recurrent tumour.	DATE:2061++DEPARTMENT:DICKINSON 2 NORTH++IDNUM:818540-31TH

1728	2674	The sample was analysed by direct sequencing. Exon 11, 13 and 17 of KIT were assessed.  The sensitivity of the test is 20-30%. At least 20-30% tumour cells should be in thespecimen to be confident of detecting a mutation if it is present.	PHI:Null

1728	3253	Comment:	PHI:Null
1728	3262	Mutations which affect the juxta-membrane domain (exon 11 and exon 13) of KIT result in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to enhanced cell proliferation.  It has been demonstrated that patients with gastro-intestinal stromal tumours with similar juxta-membrane domain mutations respond to imatinib mesylate (Heinrich MC, J Surg Oncol. 2005;90:195).

1731	3851	The left adnexal lesion is an undifferentiated carcinoma. The left ovary is not involved. While focal involvement of the left fallopian tube fimbria is seen (A9), the adjacent tubal epithelium shows no evidence of in situ carcinoma to suggest the lesion is of tubal origin. In view of the presence of endometriosis elsewhere in the specimen, the lesion may have potentially arisen in a focus of endometriosis.	PHI:Null

1732	1468	A.  The 55mm tumour within the liver a subcapsular moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The relatively circumscribed tumour is composed of tubular and complex glands, some of which are associated with central necrosis.  There is a central area of more confluent necrosis which occupies approximately approximately 10% of the tumour mass. There are several adjacent, apparently separate, smaller nodules of tumour measuring up to 2.5mm in maximum dimension.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. No tumour is seen on the serosal surface.  The resection margin is at least 20mm clear.  The tumour is compared to the previous resection specimens (caecal adenocarcinoma 45O73950) and (descending colon adenocarcinoma 45O73950) and shows similar morphological features and grade albeit with more conspicuous luminal necrosis.  The liver tumour is consistent with metastasis from a colonic primary.	IDNUM:45O73950++IDNUM:45O73950

1735	1418	A. and B. The sections show a tumour nodule of recurrent astrocytoma in a background of normal temporal lobe. The tumour nodule is identified within specimen A and is composed of a diffuse proliferation of mild to moderately atypical astrocytic cells within a fibrillary background.

1735	2163	The tumour is difficult to classify as there are overlapping morphological features between a low grade astrocytoma, WHO grade 2 and a low grade oligodendroglioma,WHO grade 2. The previous pathology was reviewed (14B35141). In the previous biopsy, the reporting pathologist also noted that morphologically the tumour was difficult to classify and in his opinion the features favoured a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. There was no evidence of 1p/19q co-deletion in previous testing.	IDNUM:14B35141
1735	2647	I have reviewed this case with Drs E Lewan and E Vaquero and the consensus opinion is that the current biopsy is consistent with a recurrent low grade glioma and the features favour a diagnosis of astrocytoma, WHO grade 2.	DOCTOR:E Lewan++DOCTOR:E Vaquero

1753	5221	B.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma which fills and expands the the uterine cavity and is wildly invasive extending into the outer half of the myometrium of the uterus in both the anterior and posterior halves.  The tumour shows extensive solid and trabecular architecture with a lesser component of glandular architecture.  There is also moderate squamous differentiation.  There is extensive tumour necrosis predominantly superficially and centrally within tumour nests.  Focally there is an area of sheet-like growth in which tumour cells display more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (block B17). At its deepest point of invasion, in an area where the myometrium is relatively thin, the tumour extends close to the serosal surface, 22.8mm through a myometrium 23mm thick (B25).  Elsewhere the tumour invades 41.5mm throughmyometrium 48.5mm in maximal thickness B10/B11). The serosa does not appear involved by tumour.  There is extensive lymphovascular invasion both within the inner and outerhalf of the myometrium.  No definite perineural invasion is seen.  The cervix is uninvolved by tumour.  The uterus also shows several leiomyomata including a lipoleiomyoma which is focally invaded by carcinoma.  A leiomyoma is also present in the posterior lower segment expanding the stromal compartment of the cervix.  The ectocervix and endocervix are otherwise unremarkarkable and uninvolved by tumour. The mucosa of the left fallopian tube is expanded by foamy histiocytes, however, no carcinoma is seen.  The right fallopian tube is unremarkable.

1753	8552	MSH6  Abnormal loss of expression in two separate tests.	PHI:Null
1753	8610	Comment:	PHI:Null
1753	8619	Absence(loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.  In this case isolated loss of MSH6 protein expression may indicate the presence of an underlying isolated MSH6 mutation.  Further testing may be beneficial if clinically indicated advised.	PHI:Null
1753	9074	Preserved nuclearstaining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI:Null

1758	2583	Fixation artefact makes assessment of architecture difficult.  The tumour displays definite areas of ductal differentiation.  There are also areas of discohesive nested growth, probably related to fixation artefact and aminor component is arranged in trabeculae or single file arrays resembling infiltrating lobular carcinoma.  E cadherin expression is predominantly retained, including in the zones showing lobular like features. There are zones of absent or patchy E cadherin staining, mainly in the discohesive tumour and this probably relates to fixation artefact rather than true lobular differentiation.	PHI:Null

1809	4524	TEST DESCRIPTION/COMMENTS	PHI:Null
1809	4550	Samples arc screened for mutations inexons 2, 3 and 4 of the KRAS gene and exons 2, 3 and 4 of the NRAS gene. These exons contain the codona 12, 13, 59, 61. 117 and 146 that are frequently mutated in colorectal cancers. Mutations at these codons lead to constitutive activation of EGFR downstream pathways. Patients whose tumours have mutation in KRAS or NRAS are unlikely to benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR therapies.	PHI:Null
1809	4975	Approximately 35-45% of metastatic colorectal tumours harbour a KR.4Smutation whilst up to 6% will have a mutation in the NRAS gene. The vast majority (~90%) of all RAS mutations occur at codon 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene.	PHI:Null
1809	5207	Depending on sample quality, analysis is by Next Generation sequencing (massively parallel sequencing), Sanger sequencing, high resolution melt (HRM) analysis or pyrosequencing.

1811	1891	A. Sections show a lesion with two distinct components.  The first component resembles neuroendocrine tumour grade 2 (WHO 2010). This component has a mixed glandular and solar architecture, and is composed of neuroendocrine tumour cells with ovoid to elongated nuclei and moderately abundant cytoplasm.  Tumour cells with large pleomorphic nuclei are seen.  There are up to 10 mitoses per 10 hpf and the Ki67 index is approximately 15%, in keeping with a WHO grade of 2. The tumour cells show diffuse strong staining forchromogranin, synaptophysin, NSE and CD56. Serotonin staining is seen in < 5% of tumour. Focal weak staining is seen for somatostatin. Insulin, glucagon and gastrin are negative.	PHI:Null
1811	2590	The second component resembles high grade sarcomatoid carcinoma, with admixed neuroendocrine tumour. This component is highly cellular, and is composed of ovoid to spindle shaped tumour cells with pleomorphic nuclei.  Spindle shaped tumour cells forming fascicles are focally present.There are up to 40 mitoses per 10 hpf and Ki67 index is > 50%. This component shows weak focal staining for cytokeratins (CAM5.2, AE1/3 and panCK), in contrast to the neuroendocrine tumour which shows diffuse strong staining. There is diffuse strong staining for vimentin. Desmin, S100, myogenin and CD99 are negative.	PHI:Null

1811	6212	MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION	PHI:Null
1811	6236	1. As reported, the large- mass in the hepatic left lobe is metastatic neuroendocrine tumour.  Part of the tumour shows the usual morphology which is predominantly of acinar type but with some trabecular areas.  However, much of the tumour also contains a second component which comprises an abnormal stromal proliferation. The stromal proliferation is most cellular around acinar structures which instead of being back-to-back are separated by the stroma but form nodular aggregates or elongated trabecular aggregates of these acini.  Further away from the epithelial elements, the stroma becomes less cellular and in some areas more myxoid with cells becoming much more spindling.  In the most cellular areas, the stromal proliferation comprises round to oval nuclei with moderately abundant clear vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are frequent (up to 5 per high power field) and there is some apoptosis.  No particular cytoplasmic differentiation is identified and no particular morphological evidence of rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation is seen.  This sarcomatous stroma appears to be confined to the nodule within the liver which appears reasonably well circumscribed.  Centrally within the nodule, there is quite extensive necrosis with cystic degeneration and some	PHI:Null
1811	7522	haemorrhage.	PHI:Null
1811	7535	The provided immunohistochemistry confirms the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour in the epithelial componentshowing a typical CK7 and CK20 negative cytokeratin profile and positive staining for chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, CD56 and neuron specific enolase.  There is diffuse positivity for CDX-2 and very focal positive staining of some neuroendocrine cells for both serotonin and somatostatin. TTF-1, insulin, glucagon and gastrin are negative.  There is no evidence staining of the stromal proliferation for cytokeratins (PanCK, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CK5/6) but there is diffuse staining of the stromal component for vimentin.  There is some positivity for smooth muscle actin but much of this appears related to proliferating blood vessels and there is a similar, although possibly more widespread staining for desmin.Myogenin is negative, as are S 100 and CD99.	PHI:Null
1811	8400	Additional and repeat immunohistochemistry has been done at NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL. Cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 show staining of the neuroendocrine component but no staining of the stromal component.  There is also totally negative staining for cytokeratins 5, 7 and 20, high molecular weight cytokeratin 34BE12 and p63. Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A, synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase are strongly positive in the neuroendocrine component but show no staining of the stromal component.  CD56 at ORROROO CAMPUS is only weakly positive (?different clone of antibody).  There is very weak patchy positivity for S100.  Due to the very primitive nature of the stromal proliferation, germ cell markers were done. Alphafetoprotein, placental alkaline phosphatase and CD30 are negative.  CD117 is negative.  CD99 shows a weak non-specific pattern of staining.  Smooth muscle actin shows positivity in blood vessels only (a less marked reaction than the SOUTHERN YORKE PENINSULA HEALTH SERVICES stain) and desmin is essentially negative although there is some positivity in spindle cells in areas which appear degenerate and ischaemic, a finding that is difficult to interpret.  Mycogen is negative.  CD31and CD34 show a fine vascular network throughout the tumour only.	HOSPITAL:NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL++HOSPITAL:ORROROO CAMPUS++HOSPITAL:SOUTHERN YORKE PENINSULA HEALTH SERVICES
1811	9681	Staining with somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) shows focal cytoplasmic and membrane positivity within the neuroendocrine component of the tumour although the reaction is fairly weak generally.	PHI:Null
1811	9875	However, glucose transporter I (GLUTI) is negative.  Positive staining with (GLUTI relates to FDG positivity on PET while SSTR2 positivity relates toGaTate positivity on PET.  It would be interesting to know what the degree of avidity on PET for both these was prior to surgery.	PHI:Null
1811	10154	Ki-67 estimation using the ROSEBUD HOSPITAL stain is estimated at 22% on the neuroendocrine component.  This is counting a hot spot in block A9 with 153/693 cells being positive. There is no defined standard as to the number of cells counted with recommended numbers varying between 500 and 2000.  The tumour is therefore, technically grade 3, although just so.  It is possible that if a larger number of cells were counted, the count would be below 20%.  The Ki-67 of the stromal component varies considerably averaging about 50% but in some areas getting up to 70-80%.	HOSPITAL:ROSEBUD HOSPITAL
1811	10725	2&3. Two further hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumour, neither showing a stromal component.  The morphology of the tumour is similar to the neuroendocrine component of the large metastasis.	PHI:Null
1811	10922	4. Sections show a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour with predominant acinar pattern with areas of sclerosis and calcification.  No evidence of a stromal component is seen. Ki-67 is considerably lower in the primary being 3% (24 of 833 cells counted).	PHI:Null

1811	11196	COMMENT	PHI:Null
1811	11204	The morphology of the stromal component in the large metastasis within the left lobe of liver is of high grade sarcoma, NOS.  It appears to be intimately involved with the neuroendocrine component of the tumour with it surrounding and separating the neuroendocrine components of the tumour where stroma is predominant within the nodule.  Mitotic rate is high and there is necrosis.  The sarcomatous stroma appears confined to the metastasis and is not seen in two other hepatic metastases or in the primary neuroendocrine tumour.	PHI:Null
1811	11734	This is a distinctly unusual finding.  I have not seen this type of stromal proliferation in relation to any neuroendocrine tumours of gastroenteropancreatic type, nor can I find literature in relation to this whether relating to hepatic metastasis or primary pancreatic, gastric or enteric tumours of neuroendocrine type.  Tumours of this pattern have been described rarely in bladder, lung and thymus.	PHI:Null
1811	12138	In both bladder and lung, this sort of sarcomatoid stroma is usually associated with high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, either small cell or large cell type. However, in the thymus, there are rare cases of lower grade neuroendocrine tumours (thymic carcinoid) with accompanying sarcomatous stroma.  A case is illustrated in the WHO Blue Book Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart (2004), p 192-193.  The comment is made that these cases pursued a highly aggressive clinical course.	PHI:Null
1811	12630	The terminology is confusing, depending on the organ system that is being addressed, but it would seem reasonable to regard the metastasis in the liver as having biphasic differentiation, possibly being called neuroendocrine carcinosarcoma or sarcomatoid neuroendocrine carcinoma.  This case may be worthy of a case report in that itis a distinctly unusual finding and the literature is silent.  As there is no literature, it is not possible to predict outcome but to my mind it would be likely be considerably less favourable than if the sarcomatoid component was not present.	PHI:Null

1814	2956	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Y Amundsen)	DOCTOR:Y Amundsen
1814	2997	A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a serous carcinoma.  Much of the tumour is moderately differentiated, comprising slit-like glands and some papillae lined by epithelial cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm.  However there is a significant proportion which consists of solid sheets and trabeculae of tumour cells so overall it is poorly differentiated.  The tumour involves the body and fundus of the uterus anteriorly and posteriorly.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion measures 9.5mm where total myometrial thickness is 14mm.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium, some of which is well away from the main invasive tumour.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Two small leiomyomas, and adenomyosis, are noted in the myometrium.  Sections of the ovaries show several small simple cysts bilaterally.  The ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.	PHI:Null

1815	4630	Endometrialcancer with loss of MLH1 expression.	PHI:Null
1815	4678	Background:	PHI:Null
1815	4690	HNPCC is most often caused by a heterozygous deleterious mutation within one of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2).  However, somatic hyper-methylation or constitutional epimutation of one of these genes can produce a similar phenotype.  Detection of methylation in the promoter region of one of these genes may be useful in determining the heritability of a cancer.	PHI:Null
1815	5076	Method	PHI:Null
1815	5083	Methylation testing is carried out on DNA extracted from paraffin embedded tumour tissue using a methylation-sensitive multiplex-ligation dependent probeamplification (MS-MLPA) technique.  Methylation-sensitive probes are protected from digestion when bound to the patient's methylated DNA and are subsequently amplified by PCR.  If the patient's DNA is not methylated a product will not beproduced.	PHI:Null
1815	5483	This method targets methylation sites in the MLH1 promoter corresponding to regions A, B, C and D (Deng et al) and in intron I.  It has been shown that methylation at regions C and D correlates with reduced MLH1 expression, whereas methylation at other sites is non-specific (Capel et al).  The MS-MLPA method provides an estimation of the percentage methylation at each site with a result of greater than 10% considered to be positive.	PHI:Null

The distal stomach measures 55mm in length, duodenum 120mm in length.  The pancreatic head measures 70 x 45 x 40mm.  Pancreatic neck resection margin is inked black, portal vein margin blue, anterior surface red, and the posterior surface green.  75mm from the distal resection margin of the duodenum and 15mm proximal to the ampulla there is an almost circumferential sessile, partly polypoid tumour measuring 50mm in length along the duodenum, it occupies approximately 95% of the bowel wall.  The tumour appears to invade through the muscularis propria and abuts the serosal surface.  The tumour also appears to invade into the pancreas and mesenteric fat however, the tumour does appear centred in the small bowel.  The bile duct appears patent throughout.  The attached right hemi-colon measures 340mm in length with an area of terminal ileum included measuring 40mm.  There is an attached unremarkable appendix measuring 65mm in length.  In the mid portion of the colon it appears puckered and adherent to the duodenum where the tumour is seen.  The tumour does not appear to extend into the bowel wall.  Mucosa appears slightly flattened in the colon, but otherwise unremarkable.  In the duodenum 60mm distal to the tumour there is a cream firm deposit on the serosal surface, the deposit measures 5mm in maximum dimension.  An area of greater omentum is adherent between the duodenum and the right colon measuring 230 x 150 x 30mm.  The attached gallbladder was received intact and measures 85mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 40mm.  The serosa appears unremarkable.  The maximum thickness of the wall is 3mm.

1831	2643	A.  Sections of uterus show a grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma involves both the anterior and posterior uterine body and contiguously invades into the outer half of the myometrium, 8.5mm through myometrium 10mm  thick (block A9). The carcinoma invades the stroma of the lower segment (blocks A1 & A6) but does not reach the endocervix.  The carcinoma is composed of tumour cells with grade 3 nuclei and arranged in sheets, trabeculae and cords within a desmoplastic stroma.  Only minor abortive glandular differentiation  is present (grade 3architecture).  Focally, the carcinoma shows squamoid differentiation, however, no intercellular prickles or keratinization is seen (block A8).  No sarcomatoid features are seen.  There is focal in-situ endometrioid adenocarcinoma (block A11).  There are moderate areas of tumour necrosis, especially superficially.There are several foci of lymphovascular invasion just beyond the advancing front of tumour, in the outer half of the myometrium (block A8 & A11).  No outlying foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen.  The carcinoma is well clear (greater than 20mm) of the ectocervical margin.

1834	1276	The entire specimen has been embedded and examined.  Sections show a multinodular goitre.  The thyroid is composed of multiple hyperplastic nodules with a mixed microfollicular and macrofollicular architecture.  There are rare lymphoidaggregates and occasional nodules showing Hurthle cell change. There are areas of degenerative change with cystic formation, acute and subacute haemorrhage, fibrosis and dystrophic calcification.  Several of the nodules show variably defined investing fibrous capsules.	PHI:Null
1834	1783	Arising within an unencapsulated mainly follicular-patterned nodule (Blocks 22-25), approximately 20mm in maximum dimension, is a multifocal papillary carcinoma with a mixed follicular and papillary architecture.  The side of the nodule is unclear as the specimen is received unoriented.  The exact dimensions of the carcinomatous component is difficult to determine as the carcinoma transitions to, and is intermingled with,follicles showing a spectrum of variable nuclear atypia, regarded as indefinite for papillary carcinoma, as well as benign follicles.  The atypical nuclear features include variable nuclear enlargement, nuclear pallor, patchy mild crowding, patchy irregularity and occasional grooves.  Some atypical follicles also contain hypereosinophilic colloid.  The whole nodule shows abrupt transition to adjacent follicles lined by low cuboidal bland epithelium. In contrast to the atypical follicles, the foci of convincing papillary carcinoma show distinct nuclear features of papillary carcinoma including rare intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions and include foci with papilliform architecture.  A 1.2mm focus of papillary carcinoma arranged in follicles is also present immediately adjacent to the 20mm nodule (Block 22).  With immunostains CK19 highlights foci with more pronounced nuclear atypia including diffuse staining of the definite carcinomatous foci, while HBME1 shows more widespread but non-diffuse staining of the 20mm nodule. No lymphovascular invasion is seen.   The clearance is difficult to assess as follicles with nuclear crush artefact, continuous with the 20mm nodule,focally abut the disrupted margin of resection (23, 23L2). Elsewhere the nodule is separated from the margin by the thin fibrous pseudocapsule of the lobe, <0.1mm clear( 24).  One normal parathyroid gland is also present. No perithyroidlymph nodes are seen.	PHI:Null
1834	3650	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1834	3659	Arising within a 20mm mainly follicular patterned nodule are multiple foci of papillary carcinoma.  Approximately 30% of the nodule shows definite nuclear features of carcinoma. Within theremainder of the nodule a substantial proportion of follicles display atypical nuclear features, regarded as indefinite for papillary carcinoma; these foci may represent follicular hyperplasia with nuclear atypia. Consensus amongst pathologists is lacking as to how to determine the maximum size of the carcinomatous component in these circumstances, although some may regard the entire 20mm nodule as carcinomatous.

1842	390	Sections show a punchbiopsy of skin including epidermis and dermis.  The epidermis shows patchy parakeratosis and moderate spongiosis with focal early vesicle formation.  Neutrophils are present in the stratum corneum focally, suggesting excoriation.  The superficial dermis is oedematous and has a mild and moderate perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.  There are also scattered interstitial eosinophils in the superficial dermis.  Focal red cell extravasation is noted in the superficial dermis and extending into the epidermis.  There is no vasculitis.	PHI:Null

1851	1502	The 280mm intra-abdominal lesion is a mesenteric fibromatosis. The fibromatosis is unencapsulated and appears largely circumscribed. The tumour is composed of bland to plump spindled cells with normochromic nucleiand pin-point nucleoli. The cells are arranged in loose fascicles within focally fibromyxoid stroma, with scattered intercellular aggregates of dense keloidal-type collagen and focally telangiectatic vessels. Scattered foci of extravasated red blood cells are seen. There is no significant cytologic atypia, significant mitotic activity or necrosis. The tumour abuts the muscularis propria of the overlying adherent segment of small bowel, which appears otherwise unremarkable. At the mesenteric surgical margin, tongues of tumour infiltrate between mature mesenteric fibroadipose tissue, and focally abut the surgical margin. Ten mesenteric lymph nodes showing reactive changes are identified (0/10).	PHI:Null

1852	2395	A.  Sections of the left mastectomy confirm the presence of two recent surgical cavities deep to the cutaneous scars at the 4 o'clock and 9-10 o'clock areas of the breast. In block two, adjacent to the surgical cavity at 4 o'clock, there is a 2.2mm collection of ducts showing partial expansion by atypical discohesive cells, most in keeping with ALH/LCIS. In block 7, within an area of fat necrosis adjacent to the surgical cavity at 9 - 10 o'clock, there is a 0.56mm focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia. Both theALH/LCIS and ADH are clear of margins (>10mm). In addition, there is a separate discrete focus of scarring associated with a prominent foreign body giant cell reaction, corresponding to the fibrotic area seen macroscopically at 2 o'clock 16cm FN, and most likely representing a previous site of biopsy/surgery. The surrounding breast tissue shows a spectrum of proliferative changes including fibrocystic change, columnar cell change, adenosis and apocrine metaplasia. Scattered suture granulomas are also present. Eighteen axillary lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/18). An incidental benign capsular lymph node inclusion is seen.

1865	8037	Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatelliteinstability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	PHI:Null
1865	8266	Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI:Null

1876	3608	The tumour described in the segment of colon including the probable anastomotic site, (anastomosis not confirmed in the sections), is the likely primary site. There is an in-situ villous component with high grade dysplasia merging with invasive malignancy extending into pericolic fat. The tumour described at the proximal end of the sigmoid colon shows features favouring metastatic origin. The bulk of the tumour is within the muscularis propria and fat, but does extend to ulcerate the mucosa which is otherwise non dysplastic.	PHI:Null

1904	348	Specimen labelled "High anterior resection sigmoid colon" and consists of a segment of large bowel measuring 170mm in length with attached mesenteric fatty tissue measuring up to 60mm across.  Roughly in the middle of the segment there is a roughened adhesion like area on the antimesenteric serosal surface measuring 40 x 30mm (inked blue).  Slicing through this area reveals a circumferential solid tumour measuring 55 x 35 x 35mm.  The tumour has pale and yellow cut surfaces.  The tumour extends to the roughened antimesenteric serosalarea and into the mesenteric fatty tissue.  The tumour is 35mm from mesenteric resection margin and 65 and 55mm from colonic resection margin.   The lumen within the tumour is narrowed down to 4mm in diameter.  There is a sessile polyp5mm in maximum dimension, 15mm from one of the colonic resection margins.  The mesenteric resection margin is inked black.  There are two solid adjacent nodules measuring 16 and 10mm in maximum dimension abutting the mesenteric resectionmargin.  There are several nodules/lymph nodes within the mesenteric fatty tissue, some of which are indurated.  The indurated nodules are sampled and the remaining lymph nodes are totally blocked.	PHI:Null

1907	3158	At the request of Dr X Dirago the margins of excision of specimen C (retroperitoneal tumour) are assessed.  The specimenwas received unoriented and was not inked grossly making assessment of margins difficult, however, in areas there is peripheral diathermy artefact or a surface layer of red blood cells consistent with the line of excision.  In an area where the specimen appears disrupted the tumour appears to reach the diathermy line over a front of about 4mm and completeness of excision is therefore regarded as doubtful (Block C3 & C4).

1908	1763	A.  Section of the livershow a 60mm deposit of metastatic carcinoma. The carcinoma is relatively well circumscribed with a thin fibrous pseudocapsule at the advancing edge. The tumour has a mixed papillary, alveolar and nested architecture with large areas of haemorrhage. The cells are large and polygonal with abundant clear to granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with patchy intracytoplasmic Schmorls positive melanin. The nuclei are central to eccentrically located with coarse to vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.  There are also occasional cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and/or multiple nuclei, prominent macronucleoli, consistent with Fuhrmann and ISUP grade 4. In some areas there are vaguely nodular areas of smaller cells surrounded by areas of larger more pleomorphic cells.  Rare foci of psammomatous calcifications are seen.  Mitosis are inconspicuous (less than 1/10 hpf) and there are patchy small foci of necrosis comprising than 5% of the tumour.  There are patchy foci of intratumoural acute and subacute haemorrhage.	PHI:Null
1908	2811	In areas the tumour abuts the liver capsule or is separated from it by intervening compressed hepatic parenchyma.  There is associated overlying capsular organising haemorrhage, however, no capsular penetration is seen.  The surgical resection margin is 5mm clear.  Thereare two foci highly suspicious for lymphovascular invasion adjacent to the subcapsular edge of the tumour (A3).	PHI:Null

1959	390	A. "UTERUS, BILATERAL OVARIES, TUBES, RECTOSIGMOID COLON". Uterus, bilateralfallopian tubes and ovaries, bowel and attached fatty tissue. Orientation is difficult but the specimen consists of uterus which is 80mm from fundus to resection margin, 55mm wide and 45mm from anterior to posterior. The left fallopian tube and ovary are difficult to identify. The left fallopian tube is approximately 20x5mm and the ovary 20x10x10mm. Directly posterior to the ?ovary is a cyst filled with mucinous/pus like material. It is 10mm in diameter. The right fallopian tube is 70x70x5-10mm. The right ovary consists of a solid/cystic/mucinous/papillary mass which is 150x120x80mm. The papillary area is on the external surface and covers an area of 80mm. The cyst is 100x80mm and the solid areas arepresent through the lesion and appear to be filled with a yellow mucinous/necrotic material. A number of papillary lesions are present on the surface of the solid areas. This mass is attached to the posterior surface of the uterus andto the segment of bowel which is located on the left posterior side and measures 120mm in length and 40mm in diameter.

1959	3040	A.  Sections of the cervix show endocervical glandular epithelium. No squamous mucosa is seen. The endomtrium appears inactive/weakly proliferative. In the myometrium there are benign leiomyomas. The left ovary has been identified and shows several benign epithelialinclusions and with endometriosis of the left ovary. The cystic structure posterior to the left ovary consists of necrotic tumour with features of an infiltrating well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with columnar epithelium. Desmoplastic stromal reaction is present. There is papillary/villoglandular architecture within cystic space. Cytoplasmic clearing is also seen in the apical cytoplasm in some areas.	PHI:Null
1959	3728	The surface papillary tumour of the right adnexal mass shows a villoglandular morphology with columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and with many cells showing apical cilia, mucin stains demonstrate some intracytoplasmic mucinous differentiation. Cytologic atypia including mitotic activity, multilayering/pseudostratification and nucleoli and mild nuclear shape variation seen. Polymorph neutrophils are seen within epithelium and within cystic space. Sections of the adjacent solid tumour show similar features but with more apical cytoplasm although ciliated cells are also seen. Apical cytoplasmic clearing is also seen insome areas. Complex architecture is seen in the solid areas. Large cystic spaces are lined by similar atypical epithelium. Tumour is also seen with small infiltrative glands  adherent to the posterior uterine surface and the anterior uterine surface, and in this region there is also adjacent endometriosis. In association with the infiltrating adenocarcinomathere is squamous differentiation with a desmoplastic stromal reaction (block A2). Endometriosis is also seen in this region.	PHI:Null
1959	4845	Sections of the colon including the resection margins are unremarkable.

1959	6788	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1959	6797	The appearances are those of an adenocarcinoma with mixed morphological features. There are features favoured to represent a predominant endometrioid differentiation (including cytoplasmic clearing imparting a so-called 'secretory' appearance), and with villoglandular architecture in many areas. The surface papillary component however has a somewhat 'seromucinous' appearance. In addition, focal areas of squamous differentiation in sections from the paracervical region and the wound nodule (consistent with squamous differentiation in endometioid adenocarcinoma).	PHI:Null
1959	7366	There is endometriosis in several sections examined.	PHI:Null

1969	2910	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Gearan):	DOCTOR:G Gearan
1969	2949	A.  The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sections show a epithelial predominant malignant mixed mullerian tumour (MMMT) centred within and replacing much of the right ovary, but also involving and expanding the lumen andwall of the right fallopian tube.  The tumour is predominantly (approximately 90%) composed of high grade serous carcinoma, however, a minority of the tumour (<5%) is associated with malignant stroma (A21) and by convention is classified as a MMMT.  No heterologous stromal differentiation is seen.  Approximately 10% of the tumour is poorly differentiated or shows clear cell differentiation (e.g. A20). A minute component of the tumour, sampled for frozen section showspossible squamous differentiation, however, no convincing endometrioid component is seen.  The carcinoma displays papillary, micropapillary and trabecular architecture and is composed of mitotically active cells with high grade nuclearfeatures.  There are extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour extends very close to but does not appear to penetrate the serosal surface.  There is associated surface haemorrhage and mesothelial proliferation.  The carcinoma involves thewall of the fallopian tube it expands much of the lumen.  The fimbrial end of the tube is not identified.   No lymphovascular invasion is seen.	PHI:Null
1969	4263	B.  Sections show mature adipose tissue.  Three (3) minute lymph node show reactive changes only.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
1969	4398	C.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of appendix show no significant abnormality.	PHI:Null
1969	4511	D.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show  nodular fibrous tissue with central cystic degeneration,extensive dystrophic calcification,  possible fat necrosis and a mild patchy chronic inflammation.  There is peripheral fibroadipose tissue and a focal surface reactive mesothelial proliferation.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
1969	4874	E.  Two of four (2/4) lymph nodes contain metastatic serous carcinoma.  The deposits measure 5.5 and 8mm in dimension.  No extranodal extension is seen.  No clear cell component or malignant stroma is seen.	PHI:Null
1969	5081	F.  One (1)lymph node shows reactive changes only.  There is no evidence of malignancy (0/1).	PHI:Null
1969	5175	G.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show diathermy affected fibromuscular tissue.  There is acute haemorrhageand a predominantly perivascular neutrophilic inflammation which is presumably surgical.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null

1971	508	MACROSCOPIC:	PHI:Null
1971	521	Specimen labelled "Lesion left chest wall stitch 12 o'clock" consists of an excision of skin with underlying soft tissue including skeletal muscle, 110 x 95 x 25mm.  There is a suture at one end indicating 12 o'clock.  There is a haemorrhagic fungatinglesion 35 x 25 x 15mm, located over the 6 o'clock half.  The lesion extends towards the 12 o'clock margin beneath the skin.  The lesion is 75 x 60 x 30mm.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and 9 o'clock black.  The specimen was serially sectioned from 12 towards 6 o'clock into twelve slices (slice one = 12 o'clock, slice twelve = 6 o'clock).  The tumour appears encapsulated with central areas of necrosis surrounded by haemorrhagic areas.  The capsule of the tumour abuts the deep and 12 o'clock margin, and is 2mm clear of the 3 o'clock margin, 15mm clear of the 9 o'clock margin and 25mm clear of the 6 o'clock margin.  The tumour does not appear to infiltrate the skeletal muscle.	PHI:Null

1971	2110	Sections are ofskin extending to deep subcutaneous tissue, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. There is an ulcerated crateriform lesion consisting of acutely inflamed fibrinous ulcer slough overlying a central core of laminated thrombus and extensive organising fibrin/haemorrhage. In areas, the organising fibrin/haemorrhage has a papilliform appearance, with cores of fibrin covered by plump endothelial cells. The endothelial cells show no significant cytologic atypia or mitotic activity. Necrosis is inconspicuous. At its periphery, the lesion is circumscribed and is surrounded by a variably thick irregular cuff of dense hyalinised fibrocollagenous tissue, organising fibrosis and fat necrosis. Special stains (Masson's trichrome, orcein and reticulin) highlight the cuff of hyalinised fibrous tissue, and although scattered distorted elastin fibers are present, no unequivocal elastic laminae are seen. Scattered collections of foamy histiocytes and cholesterol clefts are contained within the fibrocollagenous tissue. The fibrocollagenous tissue abuts the 12 o'clock (block 1) and deep margins (block 9), is 1.1mm from the 3 o'clock margin (block 4) and appearsclear of remaining margins. No infiltration of the surrounding dermocutaneous tissue by atypical cells or a vasoformative lesion is seen. The overlying intact epidermis shows reactive change and mild to moderate acute inflammatory cell exocytosis.	PHI:Null
1971	3540	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
1971	3549	The 35mm ulcerated left chest wall mass is a circumscribed lesion composedof acute ulcer slough overlying a central core of organising fibrin/haemorrhage and surrounded by a variably thick cuff of fibrous tissue. There is no significant cytologic atypia, mitotic activity, necrosis or infiltration of surroundingtissues.	PHI:Null
1971	3871	Overall, the features are most in keeping with a Masson's tumour (Papillary endothelial hyperplasia). Masson's tumours are considered to be exuberant forms of organising thrombus, and although most arise within the lumen of a vessel, extravascular Masson's tumours arise within haematomas at any site, and may present as deep soft tissue lesions. The pathologic differential diagnosis includes an angiosarcoma, however, the absenceof endothelial multi-layering, mitoses, necrosis and infiltration of the surrounding tissue, make this diagnosis unlikely.

1971	4425	The case will be sent to the Bone and Soft Tissue Meeting (DORRIGO MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE) for a second opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.	HOSPITAL:DORRIGO MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE

1980	2024	A.  Sections show a 22mm (microscopic measurement) subcapsular deposit of moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma is composed of complex and tubular glands, many with central areas of necrosis.There is also an area of parenchymal necrosis and uninvolved capsular adhesion comprised of organising fibrous tissue and striated muscle containing chronic inflammation and scattered giant cells.  The tumour does not penetrate the capsule of the liver and is 4mm clear of the surgical resection margin.  While there is tumour associated necrosis which may relate to prior therapy however the bulk of the tumour is viable.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Away from the tumour the liver shows no significant abnormality.	PHI:Null

1989	354	A.  Specimen labelled "Subtotal gastrectomy transverse colon" consists of en bloc subtotal gastrectomy with a segment of transverse colon.  The stomach is 215mm along the greater curvature and 125mm along the lesser curvature.  There is attached greater omentum 320 x 220 x 40mm, and lesser omentum 125 x 60 x 10mm.  The transverse colon is 100mm in length and75mm circumference.  There is included transverse mesocolon 65mm in width.  Over the anterior surface of the antral greater curvature there is adherent peritoneum, 75 x 30mm.  Arising within the gastric antrum, over the greater curvatureis an ulcerated tumour with a raised rolled edge.  The tumour is 90 x 75mm.  The tumour is 70mm clear of the proximal margin and 25mm clear of the distal margin.  The tumour infiltrates through the muscularis propria and into the transverse mesocolic fat.  The tumour does not appear to involve the transverse colon mucosa or muscularis propria.  There is induration and puckering of the gastric serosa over the greater curvature adjacent to the adherent peritoneum.  There is also puckering of the transverse mesocolon peritoneum.  The areas of serosal puckering are inked blue.  There is flattening of the uninvolved gastric antral rugae, immediately adjacent to the tumour.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified.	PHI:Null

Multiple areas of abscess formation are present within the mesentery surrounded by organising granulation tissue, foreign body granulomas and fibrosis.  The polyp identified macroscopically is an inflammatory pseudopolyp.  Sixteen (16) lymph nodes are identified which show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
1992	2122	B.  Sections of the appendix show a fibrinous peritonitis.  In addition there is focal mucosal ulceration with cryptitis and architectural distortion.  No transmural acute inflammation is present.  A single granuloma is noted within the appendix wall.  No organisms are identified with PAS or Truant stains.  Although these changes may be secondary to diverticular disease or an incidental appendicitis, the possibility of Crohn's disease may need to be considered.  A single benign lymph node is identified.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null

There is some resemblance in the appearances of this previous biopsy and the present specimen, however the previous biopsy is more cellular and there are more atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei than in the present specimen.  It seems most likely that the previous diagnosis is correct and that infection was introduced at the biopsy procedure, possibly by breaching the bowel.  The previous biopsy is being sent for FISH testing to look for MDM2 amplification to try and confirm the diagnosis of liposarcoma; a supplementary report will be issued.

2006	962	B.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid colon/pelvic tumour" consists of a segment of large bowel 300mm in length and varying circumference.  At one end of the bowel is a stapled margin, and the bowel is 90mm circumference.  The opposite stapled margin is shorter and appears to be submucosal, and the bowel at this end of 55mm circumference.  There is minimal attached mesocolon, 20mm in width.	PHI:Null
2006	1351	Within the mid section of the colon there is an adhesion between adjacent colon segments.  In the bowel adjacent to this adhesion there is a circumferential exophytic tan tumour, 70mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour is 120mm clear of the closest stapled margin.  The tumour perforates through the entire bowel wall thickness, with a transmural defect, 25 x 20mm.  Surrounding this defect there are serosal deposits of tan necrotic tumour, spanning an area 90mm across (inked black).  There is a large area of necrosis and probable tumour in the mesocolic fat which is entrapped between the adherent loops of bowel.	PHI:Null
2006	1968	On the opposite serosal surface, also adjacent to thebowel adhesion there is haemorrhagic and fibrinous exudate 60 x 25mm.  Within the bowel there are two pedunculated mucosal polyps, both 7mm across. These polyps are at least 30mm clear of the closet stapled margin.	PHI:Null
2006	2238	There is deposition of haemorrhagic and fibrinous exudate adjacent to the end of bowel near the first stapled margin.  This area is 40mm across, and 25mm clear of the margin.  Haemorrhagic serosal deposits are also seen near the shorter stapled margin.Lymph nodes are difficult to identify within the mesocolon.  No apical lymph node is identifiable.  Also received are multiple fragments of necrotic tumour 60mm in aggregate.	PHI:Null

2018	6461	Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	PHI:Null
2018	6691	Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	PHI:Null
2018	6826	The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.	PHI:Null

2028	2147	Sections of the 53mm paraspinal lesion confirm the presence of recurrent sarcoma. The sarcoma has variably infiltrative margins and is partially surrounded by dense fibrocollagenous tissue and skeletal muscle. The sarcoma is moderately cellular and consists of highly pleomorphic epithelioid to stellate cells arranged in sheets and ill defined fascicles within fibromyxoid stroma. The tumour cells show coarsely clumped vesicular chromatin with variably prominent nucleoli. Scattered multinucleate and occasional bizarre cells are present. The tumour contains numerous small calibre blood vessels, including some larger haemangio-pericytomatous vessels, many of which show mural fibrosis, fibrinoid change and luminal thrombi, in keeping with the history of radiotherapy. The tumour shows scattered foci of haemorrhagic cystic change, but discrete foci of necrosis are inconspicuous. There are scattered mitoses. No diagnostic lymphovascular space invasion or perineural invasion is seen.	PHI:Null

2028	3687	The 53mm paraspinal lesion shows features consistent with recurrent sarcoma. The morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining is similar to that the previously reportedcore biopsy (65A34682) and would be in keeping with a (pleomorphic) leiomyosarcoma.The tumour shows high grade cytologic atypia (tumour differentiation score = 3), however, formal histologic grading was not performed as it may be unreliable after neoadjuvant therapy.

2050	2030	A.  Two (2) of three (3) three lymph nodes contain deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma, one of which is over 2mm and the other measuring 1.5mm. No extranodal extension is seen.	PHI:Null
2050	2210	B.  Sections show a 22mm grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST.  The tumour is relatively circumscribed and and arranged in small and large nests and sheets (tubule score =3).  The tumour cells display monomorphic grade 2 nuclei with moderate eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm.   Mitoses number up to 6/10 hpf. There are numerous foci of lymphovascular invasion in the medial third of the specimen in the inferior half of the slices.  Immunostains demonstrate preserved E-cadherinexpression and patchy CD56 expression, however,  other more specific neuroendocrine markers such as Chromogranin and Synaptophysin are negative and the tumour is classified as infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST.	PHI:Null
2050	2913	A separate 3mm infiltrating carcinoma (E cadherin pending) arranged in small nests and cords (tubules score =3) with nuclear grade 1 and mitoses 0/ 3hpf, is present about 8mm deep to the main tumour (block 41) arising within a field of low to intermediate grade DCIS which measure approximately 8mm (2 consecutive slices) The DCIS is present close to but outside the confines of the main invasive carcinoma. There is also low to intermediate grade DCIS in two consecutive slices (approximately 8mm) with cribriform architecture unassociated with necrosis or calcifications.	PHI:Null
2050	3489	The breast also shows a spectrum of atypical proliferative changes including flat epithelial atypia and several foci of columnar cell change with superimposed cytological atypia and architectural atypia equivalent to atypical ductal hyperplasia.

2052	2442	B.  Sections show a 22mm grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST.  The tumour is relatively circumscribed and and arranged in small and large nests and sheets (tubule score =3).  The tumour cells display monomorphic grade 2 nuclei with moderate eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm.   Mitoses number up to 6/10 hpf. There are numerous foci of lymphovascular invasion in the medial third of the specimen in the inferior half of the slices.  Immunostains demonstrate preservedE-cadherin expression and patchy CD56 expression, however,  other more specific neuroendocrine markers such as Chromogranin and Synaptophysin are negative and the tumour is classified as infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST.	PHI:Null
2052	3145	A separate 3mm infiltrating carcinoma (E cadherin pending) arranged in small nests and cords (tubules score =3) with nuclear grade 1 and mitoses 0/ 3hpf, is present about 8mm deep to the main tumour (block 41) arising within a field of low to intermediate grade DCIS which measure approximately 8mm (2 consecutive slices) The DCIS is present close to but outside the confines of the main invasive carcinoma. There is also low to intermediate grade DCIS in two consecutive slices (approximately 8mm) with cribriform architecture unassociated with necrosis or calcifications.	PHI:Null

2064	396	Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy", consists of a specimen of terminal ileum (60mm in length), caecum and ascending colon (110mm in length).  The specimen includes unremarkable appendix is 58mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  Centred on the anterior wall of the caecum but also involving its posterior wall and the ileocecal valve is a fungating exophytic tumour 84 x 75 x 24mm.   The tumour has pale solid and mucinous cut surfaces.  The tumouris 65mm from proximal ileal and 70mm from distal margins and does not involve the base of the appendix.  The posterior surface of the caecum appears to be peritonealised.  On sectioning the tumour appears to efface the plane of the muscularis propria but does not appear to involve the mesocolic fat.   No other polyps are identified.  Several lymph nodes are identified.  The largest is 18mm in maximum dimension.	PHI:Null

The tumour is centred onthe anterior wall of the caecum but also extends onto its posterior wall and focally involves the ileocaecal valve.  The tumour contiguously invades and replaces the muscularis propria and reaches the junction of the subserosa and mesocolic fat.  The carcinoma is composed of complex and tubular glands lined by cells with stratified nuclei with moderate atypia. There is abundant intraluminal and extracellular lakes of mucin.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.  A synoptic report for bowel cancer follows.	PHI:Null

2068	1903	A. Sections show a cellular proliferation of bland fibroblastic spindle cells arranged in broad fascicles, with interspersed thin walled vessels and occasional chronic inflammatory cells. The nuclei areoval and slightly enlarged with finely granular chromatin and small distinct nucleoli.	PHI:Null
2068	2193	Mitoses are infrequent (approximately 2 per 10 hpf) and no atypical forms are identified. No necrosis or heterologous elements are seen.	PHI:Null
2068	2330	The spindle cells show positive nuclear staining with beta-Catenin and patchy staining with smooth muscle actin and desmin. Ki67 expression is low(1 - 2%). The tumour cells are negative for S100	PHI:Null
2068	2526	The lesion has a reasonably defined edge with stag-horn extensions into adjacent fibroadipose tissue. Focally the lesion extends to within 1mm of the blue inked 3 o'clock margin.	PHI:Null
2068	2705	The lesion also extends close (within 1mm) of the deep margin but this margin was noted to be somewhat fragmented macroscopically and the relation of this close margin to overlying skeletal muscle is uncertain.	PHI:Null

2069	939	Sections show a fatty tumour.There is moderate variability in size and shape of adipocytes.  There is oedema and there is a mild, patchy infiltrate of chronic inflammatory cells.  There is also some fat necrosis with infiltration by macrophages.  No significant cytologic atypia is identified apart from the variability in size and shape of adipocytes.  No definite lipoblasts are identified.  The features are favoured to be those of a benign fatty tumour (lipoma) which has some mild atypical features.  However if confident exclusion of atypical lipomatous tumour/well differentiated liposarcoma is thought desirable than FISH to look for MDM2 amplification may be worthwhile.	PHI:Null
2069	1621	The mass is partly surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule but it appears to extend to part of the inked excision margin (eg blocks 3, 3).  Tumour is seen extending into skeletal muscle, between muscle bundles, in one area near the edge (block 3).	IDNUM:3++IDNUM:3++IDNUM:3
