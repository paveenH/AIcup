The capsule of the 20mm nodule within the superior pole of the right hemithyroid is entirely embedded and examined.  The 20mm nodule shows a variably developed thin or thick capsule containing patchy dystrophic calcification, microfollicular architecture and some nuclear atypia including nuclear enlargement, small paracentral nucleoli, pallor and focal areas with nuclear grooves.  The features fall short of those of papillary carcinoma.  Focally there is full thickness invasion through the capsule in an area where the capsule is thick; no features to suggest recent fine needle aspiration biopsy is seen.  No cystic change to suggest the capsule is the result of prior rupture/repair.   Elsewhere there are a few separate nests within the capsule, some of which are closely opposed to blood vessels walls, although no vascular invasion is seen. The remainder of the thyroid shows a nodular architecture and moderate lymphocytic thyroiditis with patchy interstitial lymphoid infiltrate including reactivelymphoid follicles.  A small microfollicular patterned hyperplastic nodule with the left thyroid also show mild nuclear atypia with some pallor and nuclear grooves but the features fall well short of papillary carcinoma.  No Hurthle cell metaplasia is seen.  One right perithyroid lymph node shows reactive changes only.  No parathyroid glands are identified.  No isthmic nodule identified.	PHI:Null
file1417	3451	COMMENT:	PHI:Null
file1417	3460	The features favour a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma (capsule invasion only).    I do not think there is evidence of vascular invasion despite the close approximation of tumour cells to the walls of intracapsular vessels.  I will seek a second opinion from Prof V Schoenhard at PORT MACQUARIE BASE HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued.	DOCTOR:V Schoenhard++HOSPITAL:PORT MACQUARIE BASE HOSPITAL

file1417	4255	I am very confident that the 20mm lesion from the right lobe represents well-differentiated carcinoma.  I do not think there is any vascular space invasion and therefore the onlyissue in my mind is whether this represents minimally invasive follicular carcinoma negative for vascular space invasion, or encapsulated follicular variant papillary carcinoma positive for capsular space invasion.	PHI:Null
file1417	4648	In truth, the morphology is intermediate between these two carcinomas.  However, with this degree of atypia (albeit focal) in the presence of an invasive growth pattern, I would classify this as papillary carcinoma.  Because there is capsular invasion, the excellent prognosis associated with encapsulated follicular variant papillary carcinoma does not necessarily apply, but I would still expect this to have a good prognosis than (better than a classical papillary carcinoma of the same size of 20mm).

The reaction extends to the superficial and deep margins.  A single duct space measuring 0.3mm is partially involved by a monomorphic proliferation of cells with cribriform architecture, unassociated with calcifications.  The focus, which has cut out in deeper levels, is consistent with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and is 0.5mm from the deep margin with no intervening normal ducts (Block 5).  Adjacent ducts also show hyperplasia but are diathermy affected and disrupted limiting assessment.    There are   foci of epithelial hyperplasia of usual type and focal fibroadenomatoid change within lobules. There is also subacute haemorrhage and a giant cell reaction.  There are scattered non- contiguous calcifications associated with benign glands, distributed across eight slices over about 32mm.

There is a long silk suture presumably marking the bile duct margin.  No mucosal lesions are seen in the small bowel or stomach.  Separately there is a piece of omental fatty tissue 230 x 125 x 8mm.  There are blue marking stitches on the pancreas marking portal vein bed, SMA and uncinate margins.  The pancreatic margins are inked as follows:  portal vein bed blue, SMA red, uncinate green, posterior black. The anterior surface is inked black.  The pancreas is sliced from superior to inferior into twelve sections. There is a multilocular cyst extending from slice 1 to slice 4, 33 x 20 x 15mm.  The multiloculated cyst is filled with clear fluid and has smooth inner surfaces.  The cyst is less than 1mm from posterior, less than 1mm from anterior, 2mm from portal vein bed and well clear of all other margins.  There is a separate second biloculate cyst in slice 5, 10 x 7 x 5mm.  The second cyst is 15mm from SMA, 5mm from portal vein bed, 20mm from posterior and well clear of all other margins.  A connection between the cyst and the pancreatic main duct is not seen.  The serosal surface of the gallbladder is smooth. The mucosa is green and granular.  No gallstones are seen.

365	1415	The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Within slices five, there is a disrupted, diathermy affected papillary lesion, approximately 8mm in dimension. A diathermied incision line extends from the superficial surgical margin into the papilloma, making cytological assessment unreliable.  The lesion is composed of focally sclerosed fibrovascular cores associated with disrupted epithelial cells showing probable moderate epithelial hyperplasia.  Although the majority of epithelial cells appear to show staining with CK5/6, and P63 highlights scattered cells along the fibrovascular cores, suggesting a myoepithelial lining, interpretation may not be reliable due to the disrupted and diathermied nature of the lesion.  A small aggregate of cells do not show staining withCK5/6 or P63.  In areas the papilloma appears to be present at the superficial resection margin, however, as the specimen is disrupted, and inked has probably tracked into the space containing the papilloma, margin assessment is best assessed by the operative impression of clearance.  The superior margin appears about 1mm clear, the  inferior margin 5mm clear, the deep margin 7.5mm clear, the lateral margin about 8mm clear and the medial margin well clear.	PHI:Null
365	2664	Adjacent ducts show moderate to florid epithelial hyperplasia of usual type.  There are foci of columnar cell change without cytological atypia including foci apparently admixed with epithelial hyperplasia.  Foci of apocrine metaplasia are also present.

These atypical cells are seen throughout the entirety of the specimen.  The background stroma has a fibrous to myxoid appearance.

file10623	1379	Sections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.	PHI:Null

file10623	2954	The cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.	PHI:Null

file68265	1625	Sections show skin with underlying testis and surrounding fatty tissue.  The testis shows Leydig cell hyperplasia and age-related changes.  There is a region of fibrosis associated with an organising haematoma and focal haemosiderin deposition in keeping with previous surgery.  In addition, there are small numbers of dispersed atypical spindle to stellate cells with enlarged hyperchromatic and irregular nuclei.  These atypical cells are seen throughout the entirety of the specimen.  The background stroma has a fibrous to myxoid appearance.  In areas, the adipocytes show a mild degree of variation in cell sizes.  The histology is consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma with mixed lipoma-like and sclerosing features.	PHI:Null
file68265	2361	The atypical cells extends to the spermatic cord shave margin as well as the deep margin focally.

170	388	Specimen labelled "Right kidney" consists of a right nephrectomy, covered in perinephric fat to peritoneum, right renal vein and in situ thrombus within the renal vein measuring in total 200 x 110 x 80mm, weighing 940g.  The kidney measures 115 x 60 x 58mm and is encapsulated.  The capsule has a nodular appearance over the mid pole.  The ureter is 60mm in length x 5 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The ureter appears uninvolved with tumour.  Included with the specimen is the right adrenal gland measuring 20 x 13 x 13mm.  The adrenal appears haemorrhagic but uninvolved with tumour.  The renal vein has a length of firm yellow thrombus measuring 135 x 40 x 35mm protruding through the end of the renal vein.  On sectioning the thrombus is in continuation with the renal vein through to the hilum where the thrombus is admixed with tumour.  There is a multifocal tan/yellow tumour within the mid to lower pole of the kidney which abuts but does not breech the renal capsule.  There is also renal sinus fat involvement with a deposit of tumour measuring 7x 7 x 6mm, 5mm from the renal hilum within the sinus fat.  The tumour bulk measures 55 x 50 x 30mm within the renal parenchyma. The tumour is 65mm from the ureteric surgical margin, 50mm from the peritoneum, 45mm from the closest perinephric fat margin, and at the renal hilum. Elsewhere the kidney parenchyma appears unremarkable.	PHI:Null

file12024	1713	Sections show skin with underlying testis and surrounding fatty tissue.  The testis shows Leydig cell hyperplasia and age-related changes.  There is a region of fibrosis associated with an organising haematoma and focal haemosiderin deposition in keeping with previous surgery.  In addition, there are small numbers of dispersed atypical spindle to stellate cells with enlarged hyperchromatic and irregular nuclei.  These atypical cells are seen throughout the entirety of the specimen.  The background stroma has a fibrous to myxoid appearance.  In areas, the adipocytes show a mild degree of variation in cell sizes.  The histology is consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma with mixed lipoma-like and sclerosing features.	PHI:Null
file12024	2449	The atypical cells extends to the spermatic cord shave margin as well as the deep margin focally.

file12754	9070	KIT and PDGFRa	PHI:Null
file12754	9085	Mutations in two closely related tyrosine kinase genes KIT and PDGFRa are the molecular hallmarks of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). These gain-of-function mutations result in ligand-independent activation and pro-survival and proliferation signalling. Most GISTs (&amp;gt;80%) harbour a KIT mutation whilst 5-15% harbour a mutation in the PDGFRa gene.  The vast majority (&amp;gt;95%) of mutations found in exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12, 14 and 18 of thE PDGFRa gene. Most mutations are found within axon 11 of KIT.	PHI:Null
file12754	9634	The genotype-phenotype characteristics of mutations in these genes vary and confer different levels of response to molecular therapies.  Imatinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is considered the first choice of treatment for unresectable and metastatic tumours. KIT exon 9 mutations are lE sensitive to imatinib therapy than KIT exon 11 mutations and studies have sho patients with KIT axon 9 mutant tumours may respond better from a higher dose an alternative TKI therapy. Patients on imatinib can acquire secondary KIT mutations that render the protein insensitive to the inhibitor. Primary and secondary resistance is associated with certain mutations, e.g., those occurr in exon 13 and in exon 17 (codons 816 and 822) of the KIT gene and the mutation p.Asp842Val in exon 18 of the PDGFRa  gene.

167	1500	A.  Sections show a 7.5mm minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, mucinous subtype.  Peripherally the carcinoma shows a lepidic growth pattern with large columnar cells lining alveoli.  The tumour cells have basally oriented, mildly pleomorphic nuclei with variably conspicuous nucleoli and abundant pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm containing apical mucin. Centrally there is a 4.2mm zone of acinar growth with associated stromal fibrosis and chronicinflammation consistent with invasion.  No necrosis, lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion are seen. The pleura is uninvolved. The tumour is 30mm clear of the bronchovascular resection margin and there is no evidence of carcinoma in situ at this margin. There are peritumoural intraalveolar foamy histiocytes (obstructive pneumonia) which, with the tumour, spans 12mm, collections of pigmented intra-alveolar macrophages and minor foci of organising pneumonia.  Away from the tumour the lung parenchyma, including the pale areas detected grossly, are unremarkable.  One peribronchial lymph node shows anthracotic changeonly.	PHI:Null

file18050	3405	A-D. Sections of the visible nodular tumour show an invasive carcinoma with a predominant exophytic/polypoid growth pattern situated in distal endocervical/transformation zone tissue.  The carcinoma consists of solid sheets of large cells with variable eosinophilic and clear cell cytoplasm and in many areas shows well defined cell borders and areas of probable squamous differentiation, with angulated cell borders and a peripheral rim of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic material suggestive of keratin filaments. Frank keratinisation is not seen.  Glandular differentiation is not seen by light microscopy.  Occasional cells contain DPAS mucin vacuoles.  The appearances are consistent with moderately differentiated nonkeratinising squamous cell carcinoma with areas of clear cell change. The carcinoma abuts squamous mucosa of transformation zone in one section.  This carcinoma is predominantly exophytic and the depth of stromal invasion is very difficult to assess but is estimated at 1 mm to 1.5 mm (slides A17, A13, and A17 p16 immunostain).	PHI:Null
file18050	4454	Adjacent to the carcinoma and extending proximally along the endocervical canal there is an abnormal endocervical glandular lesion with features of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) with variable patterns. There are areas of conventional type AIS and some areas showing intracytoplasmic mucin and partial squamoid features (AIS of adenosquamous type/stratified mucinous intraepithelial lesion).  The abnormal glandular lesion has a complex growth pattern in one area and focal irregularity at the epithelial-stromal interface consistent with early invasive adenocarcinoma (A17). The stromal invasion not measurable but is well less than 0.2 mm.   This is separate from the main polypoid carcinoma.  The focus of early invasive adenocarcinoma associated with the AIS is described in &amp;apos;other findings&amp;apos;, near end of microscopic.	PHI:Null

The tumour is hypocelluar with scattered non-cohesive, plump spindled or stellate tumour cells with ill-defined, slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There is definite but mild cytological atypia.  Mitotic figures are rare (less than 1 per 10 HPF).  There are prominent elongated thin-walled blood vessels.  At the periphery, the tumour has an infiltrative pattern within invasion into surrounding skeletal muscle.  No necrosis is seen.  The appearances are consistent with those of low grade myxofibrosarcoma.  The tumour is less than 1mm to the posterior/deep margin (block 5).  The tumour is 1.5mm to the anterior margin (block 14), 2.5mm to the deep margin (block 15) and 6mm to the superior margin (block 3).  The inferior margin is well clear.	PHI:Null

139	3829	A.  Sections of the uterus and cervix show two deposits of a serous adenocarcinoma, favoured to be endometrial in origin.  The main deposit is situated within a polyp within the fundus of the uterus.  At the site of attachment of the polyp, tumour invades to a depth of 2mm through a wall thicknessof approximately 10mm.  Adjacent serous adenocarcinoma in situ extends along the endometrial surface into the lower segment.  The second deposit is situated circumferentially within the lower segment and endocervix.  As described macroscopically, the posterior cervix is absent from the specimen consistent with a previous cone biopsy and tumour extends to this resection margin.  The anterior cervix is present within the specimen and is involved with tumour to a depth of 7mm through a wall thickness of 10mm.  Carcinoma comes to within approximately 10mm of the anterior ectocervical resection margin.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The ectocervical squamous mucosa shows changes suggestive of Human Papillomavirus infection.  A number of benign leiomyomas are present within the myometrium.

file10826	6345	A.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.	PHI:Null
file10826	7198	B.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.	PHI:Null

file10826	8416	C.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.	PHI:Null
file10826	8887	D.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.	PHI:Null

Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.	PHI:Null
file10826	11592	F.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.	PHI:Null

file10826	14314	The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr Z Montecillo who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Stephen comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.	DOCTOR:Z Montecillo++DOCTOR:Stephen

file19599	3698	A-C. Sections show an endometrioid endometrial carcinoma of the uterine corpus arising in a background of complex atypical hyperplasia. The tumour shows variable morphology with areas of classic glandular architecture with focal squamous morules and areas of solid nests and sheet like areas (5-50% of the tumour). The nuclei are pleomorphic with visible nucleoli and frequent atypical mitoses and necrotic areas.  Sheets and cords of small cells accompanied by hyalinised stroma are also present, showing crush artefact.  The anterior wall of the specimen is disrupted (A4) and shows direct communication with free floating tumour nests.  However no tumour is present at the uterine surface.

file4704	4567	Tumour description:	PHI:Null
file4704	4587	There is extensive mainly surface involvement of pelvic organs by high grade serous carcinoma. The serous carcinoma has papillary, micropapillary and solid growth pattern. There is a high mitotic rate with at least 80 mitoses per 10 hpf and there are atypical mitoses. Some areas of the tumour show an endometrioid carcinoma like glandular pattern but most is typical high grade serous carcinoma pattern. There is extensive involvement of fimbrial ends of fallopian tubes and assessment of STIC in this setting is difficult. In the presence of previous serous carcinoma in an endometrial polyp the tumour could be endometrial primary with intrabdominal spread but the strong WT1 staining although not definite would tend to favour fallopian tube primary with small drop metastasis to endometrium. There is no residual endometrial involvement in the current specimen.	PHI:Null

file9735	7028	The appearances are those of poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells and the primary site appears to be the appendix. There are also nests of cells with a goblet cell morphology, however the majority of the tumour tissue does not show features of neuroendocrine differentiation. Nevertheless the appearances are suggestive that the tumour arose in a pre-existing goblet cell carcinoid but this has been overrun by mucinous adenocarcinoma.	PHI:Null

292	2528	B.  Sections show two separate infiltrating ductal carcinomas, NST.  The first carcinoma (tumour A) is a 20mm grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST located at 5 o'clock subjacent to the nipple/areolar complex. The tumour cells display moderately pleomorphic  nuclei with occasional nucleoli and are arranged in infiltrative cords and anastomosing nests within a hyaline stroma.  The tumour extends around large ducts beneath the nipple and there is minimal intermediate grade DCIS withinthe confines of the tumour. The tumour also focally extends into the dermis of the nipple/areola but no dermal lymphatic spread or Pagetoid epidermal involvement is seen.  A second separate tumour is located in the axillary tail at 2 o'clock 90mm from the nipple.  This tumour is a 12mm grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NST arising within a field of intermediate to high grade DCIS approximately 20mm in maximum dimension; the DCIS extends into the upper outerquadrant of the breast.  The infiltrative carcinoma is composed of cells with moderate to focally highly nuclei, with occasional conspicuous nucleoli and is arranged in poorly formed tubules and infiltrative nests within a sclerotic stroma.

311	1601	The sections of breast tissue show high grade ductal carcinoma in situ displaying periductal fibrosis, extension into lobules and comedo necrosis. Most of the DCIS appears non-calcified. Some of the involved ducts are distorted, but no definite invasion is seen in the H&E stained sections. Special stains are in progress.	PHI:Null
311	1924	High grade DCIS is also seen to involve scattered ducts in a Pagetoid fashion.	PHI:Null
311	2003	The DCIS measures approximately 35mm in greatest extent and is present in 7 out of 10 slices.	PHI:Null
311	2097	The surrounding breast tissue shows numerous foci of florid epithelial hyperplasia, some of which resemble small radial scars and sclerosing papillomas. Organising fibrosis, consistent with a previous biopsy site is identified.	PHI:Null
311	2325	DCIS extends to the medial margin in a numberof slices. In some foci the margin involvement appears to be the true medial margin and in other areas DCIS extends to the junction between the medial/superficial and medial/deep margins.	PHI:Null

311	2672	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:	PHI:Null
311	2695	Deeper levels and special stains (p63, keratin 5/6, AE1/AE3) were performedon selected blocks.	PHI:Null
311	2790	Block 7 demonstrated a small focus of invasive carcinoma which is present in the immunoperoxidase stained sections but was not apparent in the original H&E stained sections. Further H&E stained sections were therefore examined.	PHI:Null
311	3019	This focus measures approximately 2mm and is adjacent to ducts containing high grade DCIS.	PHI:Null
311	3111	The focus of invasive carcinoma is 0.5mm from the adjacent deep (black inked) margin.	PHI:Null
311	3198	The centre of the carcinomaconsists of fibrous tissue and chronic inflammatory cells with a rim of viable tumour at the periphery. The small amount of tumour makes grading difficult, but would score 3 for tubules and 3 for nuclei. Mitoses are difficult to see butin one high power field with well preserved tumour cells up to 4 mitoses are seen.	PHI:Null
311	3545	Overall the features would favour a grade 3 carcinoma.	PHI:Null
311	3602	No lymphovasuclar invasion is seen.	PHI:Null
311	3638	The tumour cells show very weak estrogen receptor staining of occasional tumour nuclei. Progesterone receptor is negative (both sections contain a positive control).	PHI:Null
311	3804	Ki67 expression is high (approximately 60%).	PHI:Null
311	3849	Her 2 immunoperoxidase staining shows 2 - 3+ staining. SISH is in progress.	PHI:Null
311	3925	No other foci of invasion area identified although there are areas of duct disruption (with extrusion of comedo necrosis) and distortion throughout the DCIS, making interpretation difficult.	PHI:Null
311	4116	The sections were shown to a number of pathologists within the department (including Drs B Ritchlin and B Berno) and there is consensus that this is a true focus of invasion.	DOCTOR:B Ritchlin++DOCTOR:B Berno

107	455	A.  Specimen labelled "Anterior resection" consists of a section of colon,240mm in length.  The distal end of the specimen is above the peritoneal reflection. Approximately 55mm from the closest resection margin there is a circumferential obstructing ulcerated tumour overa maximal length of bowel of 32mm.  On the peritoneal surface at the site of the tumour there is a roughened fibrous area identified, 50 x 30mm.  The cut surface reveals a cream ill defined tumour which appears to invade into the muscularis propria but not through it.  The maximum depth of invasion is 15mm.  One 10mm polyp is identified, 30mm from one of the resection margins.  Several other smaller polyps are identified.  All polyps appear confined to the mucosa.  Several diverticula are identified throughout the specimen.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified in the mesentery from 3 to 10mm.	PHI:Null

561	406	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr C Kuzara)	DOCTOR:C Kuzara
561	446	A.  Sections of bladder wall show a high grade invasive urothelial carcinoma (WHO). The carcinoma consists of infiltrative sheets, nests and cords of moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells, partially surrounded by desmoplastic stroma. Scattered highly atypical cells are present. The carcinoma shows widespread lamina propria invasion. Carcinoma cells infiltrate between thin, strips of smooth muscle, most in keeping with muscularis mucosae invasion. No unequivocal muscularis propria invasion is seen. Within the biopsies, carcinoma shows a maximal thickness of invasion of 3.3mm. No convincing carcinoma in situ is seen.	PHI:Null
561	1071	B.  Multiple levels show fragments of urothelium, including underlying lamina propria and portions of muscularis mucosae. The urothelium is largely denuded, but where present shows focal moderate to marked cytologic atypia, consistent with carcinoma in situ.

429	730	Specimen labelled "Left breast lesion with hook wire marking stitch short superior, long lateral, medium medial" consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitches and a guide wire measuring 55mm (lateral to medial) x 60mm (superior to inferior) x 20mm (superficial to deep).  There are two guide wires within the specimen.  Margins are inked in three colours:  superior - red, superficial - blue and deep - black.  Specimen is serially sectioned into ten slices from lateral to medial.  There is an ill defined tan nodule tan nodule 9 x 20 x 12mm in slices three and four.Separate from this lesion is slice five there is an 11 x 10 x 10mm tan firm nodule.  There is a punctate haemorrhage in slice four associated with the first lesion.  There are multiple punctate haemorrhages in slices seven and eight over an area measuring 11 x 8 x 8mm.	PHI:Null

429	1997	The specimen has been entirelyembedded and examined.   Sections show a spectrum of intraduct proliferative lesions including columnar cell hyperplasia, florid epithelial hyperplasia of the usualtype and multiple papillomas with superimposed florid epithelial hyperplasia.  Fibrous core biopsy tracts with adjacent subacute haemorrhage are identified (block 15, 18 and 20).  The two firm areas identified grossly within slices threeand four correspond to a 5mm sclerosing fibroadenoma with mild epithelial hyperplasia and focal glandular calcification and two adjacent intraduct papillomas, each about 4mm in dimension. One of the papillomas abuts the superficial marginat the junction with the inferior margin (block 7). The fibroadenoma is 4mm clear of the closest (deep) margin. The fibroadenoma lacks the columnar cell hyperplasia seen in the core biopsy specimen (36Q39577- specimen B), the latter morelikely corresponding to one of the benign epithelial proliferative lesions described.  A cluster of multiple intraduct papillomas, many with florid epithelial hyperplasia, is present towards the medialaspect of the specimen across approximately three consecutive slices reaching both the inferior and medial margins (block 22 & 23).  A myoepithelial cell contribution is confirmed with CK5/6 immunostaining demonstrating a benign mosaic pattern of staining. The breast tissue also shows cystic change, apocrine metaplasia, several foci of sclerosing adenosis and a focus of hyperplastic pregnancy like change (block 6).  Numerous benign glandular calcifications are present.Some of the intraduct proliferative lesions show superimposed mild architectural atypia, however, the features fall short of definite atypical ductal hyperplasia.  No in-situ carcinoma or invasive malignancy is seen.	IDNUM:36Q39577
