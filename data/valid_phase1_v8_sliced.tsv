1055	3587	The differential diagnosis in this case includes an oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm, epithelioid angiomyolipoma and renal oncocytoma.  The latter is discounted on clinical grounds (not related to adjacentkidney).  Although the tumour contains adipose tis

1055	4523	As you know large adrenal cortical lesions with oncocytic cytologic features are a very problematic and evolving area in pathology. It is clear that theWeiss criteria cannot be applied without modification to oncocytic lesions, therefore other systems such

1055	4992	Despite its very low mitotic rate and proliferative activity, this adrenal cortical tumour displays several worrying features. Firstly there is quite prominent myxoid change. Myxoid change is not definitive, but is a feature which is suggestive of malignan
1055	5218	hich is suggestive of malignancy as it occurs only very rarely in clinically benign disease (Ref: Am J Surg Pathol 2010, pp973-983). Secondly the tumour is very large. Thirdly the tumour displays a worrying growth pattern including some pseudoglandular are
1055	5444	uding some pseudoglandular areas (another feature which is not definitive but occurs more commonly in malignancies than benign tumours).
1055	5783	We and others have found IGF2 expression to be a very useful marker of adrenal cortical carcinoma and particular useful in identifying tumours with a low proliferative rate (Ref: Endocrine Related Cancer 2009, pp573-583).We have also recently reported that
1055	6009	ve also recently reported that the glucocorticoid receptor over-expressionis a strong marker of low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma (Ref; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 2009, pp4591-4599)- but this finding isyet to be confirmed prospecti

1055	6331	Therefore on the basis of the very large size of the tumour, the presence of myxoid and pseudoglandular change, and the presence of strong positive staining for both IGF2 and glucocorticoid receptor, I favour this as adrenal cortical carcinoma of myxoid an
