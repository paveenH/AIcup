1568	931	A & B.  Sections showpieces of tumour tissue.  In specimen B there are also pieces of essentially normal cerebral cortex and white matter.  The tumour is cellular and consists of cells with generally large, pleomorphic atypical nuclei and a variable amount of amphophilic or eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There are frequent mitoses, numbering up to 30 per 10 high power fields.  There is alsomicrovascular proliferation and palisaded tumour necrosis.  In one section the tumour cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm and there is a prominent associated desmoplastic stromal reaction; this is possibly an area of dural invasion.  The appearances are of glioblastoma.	PHI:Null

The tumour is an ulcerated moderate to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma originating from epidermis.  The carcinoma replaces the skin, subcutis and directly invadesthe underlying parotid gland and is about 22mm thick.  The tumour has a partly circumscribed and partly infiltrative profile and is mainly composed of nests and sheets of moderate to highly pleomorphic epithelioid and spindled squamous cells which show areas of keratinisation.  In some superficial areas the tumour has a discohesive pseudovascular appearance.  Foci of tumour necrosis are present. There are several entrapped nerves ofvarying sizes, however, no outlying foci of perineural invasion are seen.  Several moderate sized nerves towards one longitudinal margin and close to skeletal muscle are uninvolved.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. The tumour is 0.3mm from longitudinal margin, deep to striated muscle and above the level of the parotid (A9 AE1/AE3).  The tumour is 0.7m from a diathermied cleft close to one transverse margin (A6), however, the margin regarded as the true transverse margin is about 1.7mm clear.  The deep margin is 3mm clear.  One (1) lymph node at one longitudinal end is directly invaded by squamous cell carcinoma (A9).  There are some adjacent foci of actinic keratosis.

1538	598	Specimen labelled "Small bowel", consists of a 314mm length of small bowel.  There is attached omentum to a length of 120mm adherent to the length of bowel.  The serosa appears smooth and shiny. One surgical margin is inked black, and the other blue. The bowel is 15 x 16mm in diameter, and is dilated to 50 x 45mm, 110mm from the black surgical margin. At the area of transition from non- dilated to dilated colon there is a large diverticulum measuring 40 x 40mm in dimension to a length of 60mm.  The mucosa in this area is flat and smooth.  There are no areas of ulceration or tumour found in the diverticulum.	PHI:Null
1538	1213	There is an exophytic tan tumour within the wall of the bowel measuring 45 x 45mm in area.  The tumour is 15mm from the black surgical margin and 260mm away from the opposite blue surgical margin, 15mm from the diverticulum and 53mm from the transition from dilated to normal colon.  The tumour appears toinvade through to the serosa which is covered by adherent omentum.  There are 14 lymph nodes found.	PHI:Null

1538	3372	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof Z Chatfield):	DOCTOR:Z Chatfield
1538	3418	A. The sections of small bowel show diffusely infiltrative, poorlydifferentiated adenocarcinoma with a signet ring morphology.	PHI:Null
1538	3546	The tumour cells show positive staining with CDX2 and keratin 20 (patchy) but are negative for keratin 7 and TTF-1.	PHI:Null
1538	3663	Mis-Match repair gene markers show preserved nuclear staining in MSH 2 and MSH 6. Reduced nuclear staining is seen MLH 1 and PMS 2.	PHI:Null
1538	3795	Carcinoma invades through the full thickness of the small bowel wall into mesenteric fat. Ulceration is present on the mucosal aspect ofthe tumour and in other areas, carcinoma can be seen infiltrating within the lamina propria of the mucosa.	PHI:Null
1538	4038	No lymphovascular invasion is seen.	PHI:Null
1538	4074	The ends of the excision are clear of tumour and no definite involvement of the peritoneal surface is seen in these sections.	PHI:Null
1538	4200	The diverticulum is confirmed histologically and shows no inflammation or dysplasia.	PHI:Null
1538	4285	10 lymph nodes are identified, none ofwhich show evidence of malignancy (0/10).	PHI:Null
1538	4365	B. The sections of bowel show no evidence of malignancy.	PHI:Null
1538	4422	C. The sections of liver show a circumscribed tumour matching the 30mm lesion described macroscopically.  The tumour is composed of large, atypical eosinophilic cells displaying gland formation and occasional intracytoplasmic acini.  In some areas the tumour cells grow in a sheet-like and focally trabecular pattern.  The cells contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional eosinophilic globules are noted within the cytoplasm of some cells.  The nuclei show moderate to marked nuclear atypia with variably prominent nucleoli. Occasional tumour cells contain intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudo inclusions.	PHI:Null
1538	5037	No squamous differentiation, melanin pigment or bile pigment is identified.	PHI:Null
1538	5115	The Diastase stain shows positive staining of gland lining and also mucin vacuoles within individual cells.These changes are consistent with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.	PHI:Null
1538	5289	The centre of the tumour shows organising fibrosis with entrapped vessels and bile ducts.	PHI:Null
1538	5381	The tumour cells show strong positive staining for Keratin 7 and Keratin 19.   CD20 shows patchy positive staining but CDX2 is negative.	PHI:Null
1538	5520	The tumour cells are also negative for hepatocystic markers (Hepar-1, Alpha fetoprotein).  Alpha 1 antitrypsin shows diffuse positivity within the liver and also within the tumour, of uncertain significance.	PHI:Null
1538	5730	The tumour cells show patchy positive staining with CEA.  CD34 stains blood vessels within the tumour nodule and also in surrounding portal tracts.	PHI:Null
1538	5880	CD10 is negative.	PHI:Null
1538	5900	Melanocytic markers (HMB45 and S100) are negative.	PHI:Null
1538	5953	Prostatic specific antigens and TTF1 are both negative.	PHI:Null
1538	6011	liver immediately surrounding the tumour deposit shows mild fatty change.  The portal tracts are variably expanded by proliferating bile ductules and a mixed, predominately chronic, inflammatory cells infiltrate.  Chronic inflammatory cells are also noted within the hepatic lobules.  No bile lakes are seen but there is mild sinusoidal dilatation.  These changes may reflect local obstructive or reactive changes due to the presence of a tumour nodule.  Elsewhere the liver is non cirrhotic and shows mild steatosis and a mild increase in inflammatory cells within the portal tracts.	PHI:Null
1538	6598	The tumour is clear of the surgical margin in the region of the porta hepatis by 10mm.	PHI:Null
1538	6687	The morphological and Immunohistochemical appearances of the tumour in the liver are distinctly different to those seen in the small bowel tumour.  This would support the theory that these represent two separate neoplastic processes.  Neither tumour is particularly typical of colorectal carcinoma however a signet ring morphology is sometimes seen in colorectal carcinomas and therefore the smallbowel tumour may still represent a metastasis from that site.  The morphology of the liver tumour however is more suggestive of either a primary cholangiocarcinoma in the liver or metastatic carcinoma from an upper gastrointestinal siteor possibly a pancreaticobiliary origin.	PHI:Null
1538	7363	I have discussed this case with the surgical registrar Dr Gudara KODAMA and no history of other primary neoplasms has been found in thispatient.  We have requested the previous colorectal pathology from WANTIRNA HEALTH Hospital for comparison to both tumours.	DOCTOR:Gudara KODAMA++HOSPITAL:WANTIRNA HEALTH

1538	7992	Sections of the previous colorectal carcinoma were received from PRINCE OF WALESPRIVATE Pathology Service on 15/1/2063 (seereview 91Z98739).	DEPARTMENT:PRINCE OF WALESPRIVATE++DATE:15/1/2063++IDNUM:91Z98739
1538	8133	The morphology of the previous colorectal carcinoma was compared to the current small bowel and hepatic tumours. All three tumours have morphologically dissimilar appearances, suggesting that these represent three separate primary tumours.	PHI:Null
1538	8373	In view of the alteration to staining of MLH 1 and PMS 2 (loss of nuclear staining) in the small bowel tumour (documented in the original report above), it is possible that this patient may have an underlying mis-match repair abnormality.	PHI:Null

1719	2957	A.  Histology shows a distended appendix with the mucosa replaced by relatively monotonous flattened columnar mucinous epithelium which shows some micropapillary tufting in places.  There is low grade cytological atypia and morphology is consistent with that of a low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  Additionally, there are widespread deposits of abundant extracellular mucinous material over the serosal aspect of the appendix and also within the wall which shows fibrosis and loss of the muscularis propria in places.  Scattered within these mucinous pools are occasional strips of low grade atypical mucinous epithelium.  No areas of high grade or frankly malignant invasive adenocarcinoma are seen.  At the proximal end of the appendix adjacent to the resection margin the mucosa appears more normal showing only minor hyperplastic changes with no significant atypia.	PHI:Null

Histology shows deposits of mucinous tumour within the peritoneal tissue, over the serosa and within the stroma, predominantly of the left ovary, with small deposits also seen over the serosa of the left fallopian tube, right ovary, focally the serosa of the uterus, gallbladder and spleen.  In most of these areas, the cytology of the epithelium is predominantlylow grade, but within the left ovary there is moderate cytological atypia, more in keeping with intermediate grade mucinous tumour, although not frankly malignant high-grade adenocarcinoma.  Otherwise the endometrium of the uterus is atrophic with mild adenomyosis.  A small intramural leiomyoma is also seen.  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.

1094	4199	A.  Concern was raised at the Gynaecologic Oncology Meeting on 3.9.63 about the nature of a nodule on a fold of peritoneum between the bladder and cervix, which had not been sectioned.  The specimen was therefore re-examined.  A mucoid nodule around 10mm diameter was identified in the flap of peritoneum on the anterior endocervix, left side, and sections were taken (blocks A23 - A28).  The sections show only oedematous and inflammatory tissue with suture material from previous surgery; no tumour is seen.	DATE:3.9.63
