1021	2907	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene. 
1021	3175	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

1024	1696	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Spritzer):   
1024	1739	Sections of uterus show a poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma (grade 3).  Majority of tumour (more than 70%) show solid sheet-like growth pattern.  Focal areas of necrosis are present.  The tumour involves the entire uterine cavity including the lower uterine segment.  The tumour invades the wall of cervix but the ectocervix itself is not involved.  The ectocervical margin is clear.  There is extensive lymphovascular invasion.  The tumour invades the full thickness of myometrial wall and involves the serosa/parametria in multiple areas.  The maximal depth oftumour invasion and myometrial wall thickness is 25mm.  Several small benign leiomyomas are present within the myometrium.  Multiple tumour deposits are seen on the serosal surface of both ovaries.  Right ovary also shows tumour metastasis within its parenchyma and lymphovascular invasion.  Both fallopian tubes are unremarkable.

1025	335	47 year old woman with grade 2 adenocarcinoma.  However at surgery tumour seems to be endocervical than endometrial.  Please do ER and PR and appropriate stains to help differentiate between endometrial and endocervical origin.    
1025	566	MACROSCOPIC: 
1025	579	A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus tubes ovaries", consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing 156g, and detached fragments of necrotic tumour.  The uterus measures 100 x 50 x 40mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The serosa of the left posterior lower segment serosa has a full thickness defect 15 x 15mm, with tumour exuding through.  The ectocervix measures45 x 35mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 3mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 18mm in maximum thickness.  The endometrium has an exophytic tan tumour which is located in the lower uterine segment, 10mm from the cervical os, 40mm from the left cornu and 40mm from the right cornu.  The tumour is circumferential and measures 70 x 40 x 25mm thick.  The tumour has perforated through the serosa posteriorly on the left.  Inferiorto the tumour, along the cervical lips, the ectocervix appears buckled and roughened.  The right fallopian tube measures 52mm in length x 10 x 10mm in maximum dimension.  The right ovary measures 32 x 28 x 20mm and there is a rupturedcystic structure within the ovary which measures 18 x 8 x 15mm.  The cystic area has a smooth external surface and the internal surface has multiple papillary projections into the cystic space.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length x 8 x 7mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary is 40 x 20 x 15mm and has two smooth lined cysts measuring from 5 and 10mm in maximum dimension.   
1025	2074	Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 and 5 - TS through left lateral anterior tumour and serosa; 6 to 9 and 10 to 13 - two full longitudinal sections of posterior body and cervix; 14 to 16 - TS through tumour and area of perforation through to serosa; 17- right fallopian tube; 18 to 22 - right ovary AE; 23 - left fallopian tube; 24 to 29 - left ovary AE; 30 - tumour reserve block. 
1025	2496	B.  Specimen labelled "Right, ileac nodes", consists of a nodular tan piece of tissue measuring 5 x 3 x 3mm.  One 5mm lymph node is identified. AE 1 block.  
1025	2653	C.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic nodes", consists of three pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 35, 15 and 10mm in maximum dimension.  There are four lymph nodes identifiedfrom 2 to 10mm in maximum dimension.  AE 2 blocks.  
1025	2880	D.  Specimen labelled "Left pelvic peritoneum", consists of a tan piece of tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.  
1025	3001	E.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consists of two pieces of fibrofatty tissue measuring 90 x 50 x 10mm and 35 x 20 x 5mm.  There are firm nodular areas within the omentum from 5 to 20mm in maximum dimension.  Representative in 3 blocks. 
1025	3237	(TO: KB;EY/vo 29.10.63)  
1025	3262	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Barsness): 
1025	3303	A.  Sections show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the lower uterine segment.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 8mm out of total myometrial thickness of 8mm, with tumour fungating out through the serosa (block A16).  Some of the tumour is composed of clear cells but this is interpreted as clear cell change in an endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  No good evidence of a clear cell carcinoma is seen.  There is lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium.  There isstromal invasion of the upper endocervix.  The ectocervical excision margins are well clear of tumour.  The uterus does not show any other significant abnormality.   
1025	3942	IMMUNOSTAINS:   
1025	3958	Oestrogen receptor:  Positive.  75% of tumour cells show positive staining.   
1025	4036	                                  Predominant staining intensity - moderate. 
1025	4113	Progesterone receptor:  Negative.   
1025	4149	Vimentin:  Positive. 
1025	4170	CEA:  Patchy positive.   
1025	4195	p16:  Patchy positive.   
1025	4220	MSI STAINS: 
1025	4232	MLH1 - Preserved nuclear staining. 
1025	4267	PMS2 - Preserved nuclear staining.  
1025	4303	MSH2 - Loss of nuclear staining.   
1025	4338	MSH6 - Loss of nuclear staining.   
1025	4373	Loss of nuclear staining of a carcinoma for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of germline mutation or somatic inactivationof that mismatch repair gene.   
1025	4645	The appearance of the uterine tumour, together with the immunoprofile (Vimentin positive, ER positive, CEA only patchy positive and p16 only patchy, rather than strongly and diffusely, positive) indicates that this is a primary endometrial rather than endocervical carcinoma.  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the lower segment is associated with Lynch syndrome.   
1025	5008	Sections of the right ovary show a grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with a very similar appearance to the endometrial tumour.  Given the depth of invasion of the endometrioidtumour, and the histologic similarity, this may well be a metastasis from the endometrium rather than a separate primary.   
1025	5309	Sections of the left ovary show a corpus luteum and a cystic follicle.  The left ovary is otherwise unremarkable.  Sections of the fallopian tubes are unremarkable.   
1025	5476	Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr L Josich.   
1025	5539	B.  Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.   
1025	5595	C.  Sections show four lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.   
1025	5653	D.  Sections show mesothelium with underlying tissue.  There is some recent haemorrhage and focal chronic inflammation but no tumour is seen.   
1025	5797	E.  Sections show omentum.  There are patchy areas of organising haemorrhage and fibrin with associated fibrosis and haemosiderin laden macrophages but no tumour isseen.   
1025	5970	DIAGNOSIS: 
1025	5981	A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:   
1025	6024	-  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of lower segment endometrium with invasion to serosal surface and cervical involvement.   
1025	6153	-  Grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of right ovary, ?metastatic.   
1025	6223	B.  Right iliac node:  No tumour (0/1).

1027	327	CLINICAL: 
1027	337	Small bowel resection ?carcinoid - pelvic lipomatous tumour. 
1027	398	Additional information obtained from Prof. Jeffry: 
1027	449	The pelvic tumour is retroperitoneal and the mesenteric mass in specimen A appears grossly clear of the mesenteric margin.   
1027	574	MACROSCOPIC: 
1027	587	A.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel" consists of a portion of small bowel measuring111mm in length and 50mm in open circumference.  There is mesentery throughout the length to a width of 80mm. At the edge of the mesentery there is an irregular mass measuring 40 x 36 x 29mm.  The mesentery is disorted and the true mesenteric margin is not confidently identified.  Located 32mm from one of the longitudinal ends within an antimesenteric portion of the small bowel wall is a firm cream tumour measuring 14 x11mm of the bowel.  The mucosa appears intact over the tumour. On the external surface there is some puckering overlying this lesion.  On sectioning of the mesenteric mass, the lesion is ill defined firm and white with patchy focal haemorrhagic areas.   
1027	1346	Blocks:  1 - surgical margin near mucosal tumour; 2- surgical margin away from tumour; 3 & 4 - mucosal lesion AE; 5 to 16 - mesenteric lesion AE; 17 - mesenteric tumour deposit/lymph nodes; 18 - one trisected lymph node; 19 - five lymph nodes. 
1027	1590	B.  Specimenlabelled "Proximal small bowel" consists of a portion of small bowel measuring 172mm in length and 45mm in open circumference.  Located 6mm from one end there is an non-ulcerated intramural tumour measuring 13x11mm.  There is a second smaller non-ulcerated intramural tumour located 49mm from the same margin measuring 5 x 4mm.  The mesentery extends for the length of the bowel to a width of 48mm.   
1027	2003	Blocks:  1 to 3 tumour with surgical margin; 4 - representativeother surgical margin; 5 - smaller tumour AE; 6 - four possible lymph nodes; 7 - three possible lymph nodes; 8 - representative mucosa. 
1027	2202	C.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic tumour" consists of a fatty tumour measuring 65 x 70 x30mm.  Sectioning shows uniform fatty tissue with some diffuse patchy haemorrhagic specks.  Ten representative blocks.   
1027	2407	D.  Specimen labelled "Appendix" consists of an appendix measuring up to 75mm in length and 10mmin maximal diameter.  There is mesoappendix from the tip up to a length of 45mm and extends out to 29mm.  The external surface is unremarkable.  The lumen contains a faecalith.  There is a thickening at the tip measuring up to 14mm in length.   
1027	2748	Blocks:  1 - TS surgical margin and LS proximal; 2 - five TS; 3 & 4 - LS tip; 5 -?mesoappendix lymph nodes.  (TO: EJ; JH/mm 18.3.63)  
1027	2882	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr F Setzler) 
1027	2923	A & B.  Sections show a 14mm grade 2 well differentiated small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour (specimen A). The 40mm tumour within the mesentery of specimen A is a group of closely apposed lymph nodes completely or almost completely replaced by metastatic neuroendocrine tumour with areas of extranodal extension.  There is also perinodal lymphatic involvement, a focus suspicious for large vessel involvement (block A17) and several extranodal deposits probably arising from lymphatic spread. 
1027	3419	Within specimen B two (2) additional separate grade 1 well differentiated small intestinal neuroendocrine tumours (carcinoids) 13mm and 5mm respectively are also present.

1027	4043	Two (2) well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours; Grade 1 (specimen B) 
1027	4116	Morphological Description: 
1027	4143	The three small intestinal tumours show similarmorphology and are composed of cells mainly arranged in solid nests. The tumour cells have fairly uniform nuclei, stippled chromatin and granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, often more accentuated in the periphery of the nests.  Scattered tumour cells have moderately pleomorphic nuclei.  The small intestinal tumour in specimen A also shows a minor component of glandular differentiation.  The mesenteric lymph node metastases and extranodal deposits show similar morphology tothe intestinal tumours.   
1027	4690	Immunohistochemistry:  
1027	4713	The three small intestinal tumours show positive diffuse staining with synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The CD56stain is negative.

1027	4978	Tumour 1  
1027	4988	Tumour 1 invades through the full thickness of small bowel wall.  It abuts the serosal aspect of the small bowelwall across a broad front and focally penetrates the serosa (visceral peritoneum) (block A4) with associated focal fibrin deposition. 
1027	5234	Tumour 2 
1027	5243	Tumour invades the outer half of themuscularis propria (block B2).

1027	5500	 -Tumour 3 (specimen B):  49mm clear 
1027	5537	- Mesenteric (radial) margin  
1027	5567	(specimen A): Mural tumour well clear, mesenteric nodal mass- cannot be assessed (margin not identified at gross dissection). 
1027	5693	(specimen B):  Well clear. 
1027	5721	Lymphovascular Invasion  
1027	5746	- Mural:  Suspicious (specimen A).  Retraction artefact makes assessment difficult. 
1027	5830	- Mesenteric:  Present (specimen A).  Multiple foci of perinodal lymphovascular invasion are seen within the mesentery in proximity to the involved lymph nodes (eg. blocks A7, A9 and A11) and a focus suspicious for extramural large vessel  involvement (block A17) is also present. 
1027	6111	-     Nil seen in specimen B. 
1027	6141	Perineural Invasion: 
1027	6162	-     Present, several foci within the mesentery(specimen A)(block A17). 
1027	6235	-     Nil seen in specimen B. 
1027	6265	Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN1:  Metastasis in regional lymph nodes . 
1027	6331	Extranodal extension:  Present, numerous foci (specimen A). 
1027	6391	Number of lymph nodes examined:  The exact number of lymph nodes in the mesentery in specimen A cannot be accurately determined as individual lymph nodes were not separately identified within the mesenteric mass at gross dissection, however it may be as high as the following estimate. 
1027	6677	- Specimen A (estimate):  up to 21 
1027	6712	-     Specimen B:  7 
1027	6733	Number of lymph nodes involved by metastatic tumour: 
1027	6786	-     Specimen A (estimate): up to 11 (11/21)

1027	6858	Pathological Staging (AJCC, 7th Edition 2010):  mpT4 N1 
1027	6915	Additional Pathological Findings:  No endocrine cell hyperplasia, tumour necrosis or psammoma bodies are seen.  Occasional vessels within the mesentery in proximity to the tumour display adventitial elastosis and mural muscular hypertrophy but no complete luminal occlusion is seen.  Away from the tumour the small bowel wall including mucosa is unremarkable.  No Brunner's glands are seen in specimen B (labelled proximal small bowel). 
1027	7352	C.  Sections show an apparently unencapsulated tumour composed of mature adipose tissue showing no significant variation in cell size.  Very rare adipocytes nuclei display mild nuclear enlargement and hyperchromism but nolipoblasts or fibrous bands containing atypical stromal cells are seen. 
1027	7645	COMMENT: 
1027	7654	The morphological appearances favour a retroperitoneal lipoma.  As this is a rare entity; to exclude the possibility of a lipoma-like liposarcoma tissue will be sent to LISMORE BASE HOSPITAL - RIVERLANDS DRUG & ALCOHOL SERVICE's Hospital for MDM2 analysis.  A supplementary report will be issued. 
1027	7951	D.  Sections show three (3) separate incidental well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (carcinoids). The tumours measure 0.7mm, 0.8mm and 1.5mm in maximum dimension and are located within the tip of the appendix within an area showing luminal and mucosal fibrous obliteration.

1028	476	MACROSCOPIC: 
1028	489	A.  Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a segment of terminal ileum measuring 175mm in length x 12mm in diameter adjoining the caecum and ascending colon measuring 130mm inlength x 60mm in maximum dimension.  The appendix has been previously removed.  The mesentery wraps around the ascending colon.  The ascending colon has a large ulcerated diverticulum measuring 70mm in length x 25mm in maximum dimensionand this is lined by solid cream nodules of tumour.  The diverticulum is 70mm from the ileocaecal valve and 42mm from the distal surgical margin (ascending colon).  Within and adjacent to the diverticulum there are several hard nodulesof tumour in the bowel wall.  The largest tumour deposit is 25 x 15 x 15mm and is at the tip of the diverticulum.  Tumour also appears to involve part of the bowel the serosa and mesentery.  The tumour nodules have a solid white homogeneous cut surface.  A small tumour nodule is also identified in the bowel wall at the distal surgical margin.  The terminal ileum is unremarkable.  Representative sections.

1028	2794	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr T Grivno):  
1028	2834	A.  Sections of the largest described tumour mass in the diverticulumshow a deposit of moderately differentiated serous carcinoma ulcerating the mucosa and involving submucosa, muscularis propria and subserosaltissue.  The tumour consists of sheets and trabeculae of cells with large nuclei and a variable amount of amphophilic cytoplasm.  These cells form slit-like glands.  Mitoses are frequent.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in the adjacent bowel wall and extending throughout the mesentery.  There are multiple, variable sized tumour deposits identified in the bowel wall at, and near, the diverticulum, and in the mesentery.  Many of these deposits are centred on vessels.  At least one tumour deposit is seenextending to the serosal surface of the colon focally.  Several variable sized tumour nodules are present within the submucosa, muscle layer and subserosa of the colon wall at the distal resection margin.   
1028	3769	With immunostains the tumour cells are strongly cytokeratin 7 and CA-125 positive, but cytokeratin 20 negative, consistent with serous carcinoma.  In addition to the multiple described tumour nodules in the mesentery, at least seven lymph nodes containing metastatic carcinoma are also identified. 
1028	4067	B.  Sections show liver with adeposit of moderately differentiated serous carcinoma, similar to specimen A.  Lymphovascular invasion is noted just outside the main tumour mass.  Tumour also extends into part of the adherent fibrofat on the serosal surface of the liver.  The liver otherwise does not show any significant abnormality.    
1028	4404	C.  Sections show pieces of fibrofat with involvement by moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  
1028	4506	DIAGNOSIS:

1029	523	MACROSCOPIC: 
1029	536	A.  Specimenlabelled "Left colon tumour" consists of a segment of bowel measuring 140mm in length.  Adherent to the serosal surface of the bowel is a large mass measuring 180 x 100 x 150mm with attached fat measuring 220 x 50 x 10mm.  The mucosal surface of the bowel is unremarkable. On sectioning the tumour appears to abut the serosal wall of the bowel but not invade it. The cut surface of the tumour has a variegated appearance and is composed of multicystic spaces, comprising approximately 20% of the tumour area, as well as, solid cream fleshy tumour, areas of necrosis and approximately 20% which contains bony hard tumour.  Several lymph nodes/tumour deposits are identified in the attached fat.

1029	1793	(CA/ta 8/7/63)  
1029	1811	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Y Tulis/Dr Y ALLEN-Rauen) 
1029	1866	A - C.  Specimens A - C show similar histopathological features. The left colon tumour, small bowel and omental nodules are foci of high grade malignant sarcoma. The sarcoma has a mixed malignant spindled cell, as well as, osteo-chondrosarcomatous component. Highly pleomorphic malignant spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells are present. There are scattered foci of necrosis and calcification. Although most of the tumour expands the pericolic fat, the tumour focally infiltrates the outer layers of the muscularis propria (blockA6). The overlying mucosa and submucosa appear unremarkable. The bowel surgical margins appear clear of tumour, although there is a tumour nodule within the pericolic adipose tissue, 6mm from one margin. Eight separate deposits are also seen in the surrounding pericolic fat.  
1029	2680	COMMENT: 
1029	2689	The left colon tumour, small bowel and omental nodules are foci of high grade malignant sarcoma. The sarcoma has a variable appearance with a high grade malignant spindled cell component admixed with osteochondrosarcomatous areas. The morphology is similar to that of the previously described pelvic tumour and would be consistent with a leiomyosarcoma with extensive high grade osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma-like areas (?dedifferentiation) (NSW Health RIVERVIEW YO-72-351732/Reviewed by Professors Jamar and Jack).

(TO: ZW/ta 27/5/64)  
1031	1913	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr W Engard) 
1031	1953	Sections of the uterine tumour show a Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma consists predominantly of complex, crowded glands, some of which have a cribriform morphology, lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGO architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 1). The carcinoma extends 2.2mm into a uterine wall 12mm thick. There is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion. The carcinoma does not involve the sampled uterine cornua. 
1031	2440	The non-neoplastic endometrium shows patchy atypical complex endometrial hyperplasia. There iswidespread adenomyosis and scattered benign leiomyomas. The uterine cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality.

1031	3282	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 orMSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene. 
1031	3549	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a lowlikelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

A section of the stomach is 80mm in length with lesser curvature 60mm in length and greater curvature measuring 45mm in length and a resection margin measuring 80mm in length.  There is a section of small bowel measuring 150mm in length which is looped around the gastroenterostomy site.  Thereis a sleave of transverse colon mucosa measuring 30 x 20mm which is adherent over the gastroenterostomy site.  There is a section of unremarkable greater omentum measuring 210 x 110 x 15mm which is attached from the greater curvature and adherent over the tumour site. At the site of the gastroenterostomy there is a circumferential deeply invasive ulcerated tumour extending from the distal stomach around the gastroenterostomy site into efferent loop of small bowel and also extending into the afferent loop of small bowel where the loop of small bowel is adherent upon itself.  The tumour measures approximately 55 x 50 x 35mm.  The cut surface reveals the tumour extends into the stomach over a length of 22mm and involving 40mm of the efferent small bowel and 20mm of the afferent small bowel.  The tumour appears to invade through the muscularis propria and into the surrounding fatty tissue and focally abuts the serosal surface and appears to invade into the muscularis of the cancerous colon.  No definite lymph nodes are identified along the greater curvature orthe fat surrounding the adherent transverse colon.

1033	3710	Comment: 
1033	3719	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated withmicrosatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene. 
1033	3986	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

1046	2235	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr J Schlimmer):  
1046	2278	A. The sections show high grade carcinoma in the posterior uterine wall, serosa of the adjacent colon, fallopian tubes, ovaries and adjacent fibrofatty tissue.  Some tumour cells show squamoid or rhabdoid features and many highly atypical tumour cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli are seen.  In some areas, the tumour cells show degenerative changes but no areas of necrosis are found.  Mitoses are readily found.  There is mild fibrosis.  Tumour cells are seen within thin walled lymphovascular channels.  The uninvolved endometrium is proliferative.  One of the leiomyomata shows an area of hyaline necrosis with dystrophic calcification.  no atypical features are seen in the other leiomyomata.   No tumour is seen in the proximal and distal margins of the colon or in the sections of cervix.  
1046	3099	B. The sections show widespread high grade carcinoma replacing most of the omental tissue. The tumour shows nests of pleomorphic cells with intervening fibrosis.  The appearances are consistent with chemotherapy related changes.

1053	3251	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Solwold):  
1053	3292	A.  The ovary has been extensively sampled.  Most of the lesion shows a fibrotic cyst wall with extensive organised haemorrhage, haemosiderin and foamy macrophages. 
1053	3457	In addition, there is residual epithelial lining focally with features of a well differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma. 
1053	3582	B.  Sections show a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.  The main tumour has a maximum depth of 26mm througha wall 40mm thick.  However there is a non-contiguous focus of serosal grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma (block 27) adjacent to endometriosis (not associated with ovarian tissue).  No definite lymphvascular invasion is seen. 
1053	3937	Theectocervix and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable. 
1053	3999	The right ovary is unremarkable.  The right tube is not identified. 
1053	4067	C & D.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
1053	4111	COMMENT: 
1053	4120	Given the extensive endometroid adenocarcinoma in the uterus and the unusual haemorrhagic appearance of the ovarian tumour, the ovarian tumour is favoured as a probable metastasis from the uterine tumour (however a synchronous primary cannot be totally excluded). 
1053	4384	DIAGNOSIS: 
1053	4395	Extensive grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with serosal involvement (see text above) and probable metastasis to the left ovary. 
1053	4545	The omentum is negative.

(XB/ta 28/11/62)  
1055	2215	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Fair) 
1055	2251	A & B.  Sections show a predominantly unencapsulated tumour with no definite connection to adjacent adrenal gland. The tumour shows variable cellularity in which the great majority of cells have an oncocytic appearance with abundant granular pink cytoplasm.  In less cellular areas tumour cells are separated by mucin or oedema fluid. The tumour cells are arranged in small acinar and trabecular formations with an intervening fine vascular network.  Adipose tissue focally surrounds the tumour however deposits of adipose tissue are also seen within the tumour.  Numerous thick walled blood vessels are present.  No convincing spindle cell component is seen.  Although focally some of the tumour cells show bizarre nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses are extremely rare and the Ki67 index is less than 1%.  In two representative sections (blocks B15 & B16) the oncocytic tumour cells blend with cells which appear adrenocortical in nature with abundant multivacuolated clear cytoplasm.  Focally the diathermied resection margin transects the tumour.  
1055	3297	The tumour cells show strong positive staining with vimentin and CD10.  There is moderate staining with NSE and patchy staining with MelanA, PanCK and AE1/3. The EMA, calretinin, inhibin, HMB-45, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CK7, CK20, C-kit, Hepar-1 and SMA stains are negative.  
1055	3578	COMMENT: 
1055	3587	The differential diagnosis in this case includes an oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm, epithelioid angiomyolipoma and renal oncocytoma.  The latter is discounted on clinical grounds (not related to adjacentkidney).  Although the tumour contains adipose tissue and thick walled blood vessels, there is insufficient immunohistochemical evidence for an angiomyolipoma. The favoured diagnosis in this case is an oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm and due to the size, the tumour would be classified as having borderline malignant potential (Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia criteria).Due to the unusual nature of this tumour a second opinion will be sought.  
1055	4228	DIAGNOSIS:   
1055	4241	A & B.  Abdominal mass:  
1055	4266	-   Favour oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm. 
1055	4312	-   Borderline malignant potential.

1055	4370	ADDITIONAL REPORT (24/12/62): 
1055	4400	A/Prof H Martinsen, THE PRINCE CHARLES HOSPITAL, reports: 
1055	4458	"Thank you for the opportunity to see the slides from this case. 
1055	4523	As you know large adrenal cortical lesions with oncocytic cytologic features are a very problematic and evolving area in pathology. It is clear that theWeiss criteria cannot be applied without modification to oncocytic lesions, therefore other systems such as the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia system (LWB) have been proposed as has the reticulin algorithm. The reason why so many systems have been proposed is that none have been proven to be completely sensitive and specific. 
1055	4992	Despite its very low mitotic rate and proliferative activity, this adrenal cortical tumour displays several worrying features. Firstly there is quite prominent myxoid change. Myxoid change is not definitive, but is a feature which is suggestive of malignancy as it occurs only very rarely in clinically benign disease (Ref: Am J Surg Pathol 2010, pp973-983). Secondly the tumour is very large. Thirdly the tumour displays a worrying growth pattern including some pseudoglandular areas (another feature which is not definitive but occurs more commonly in malignancies than benign tumours). 
1055	5581	We have performed additional Immunohistochemistry which is as follows; 
1055	5652	Glucocorticoid receptor: Diffuse strong nuclear expression (glucocorticoid score 4+) 
1055	5737	IGF2: Positive (perinuclear dot-like pattern) 
1055	5783	We and others have found IGF2 expression to be a very useful marker of adrenal cortical carcinoma and particular useful in identifying tumours with a low proliferative rate (Ref: Endocrine Related Cancer 2009, pp573-583).We have also recently reported that the glucocorticoid receptor over-expressionis a strong marker of low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma (Ref; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 2009, pp4591-4599)- but this finding isyet to be confirmed prospectively or by another group and so should be considered preliminary. 
1055	6331	Therefore on the basis of the very large size of the tumour, the presence of myxoid and pseudoglandular change, and the presence of strong positive staining for both IGF2 and glucocorticoid receptor, I favour this as adrenal cortical carcinoma of myxoid and oncocytic type. 
1055	6605	I emphasise that the mitotic rate is low as is the Ki67 proliferative index (<1%). Therefore the tumour is classified as low-grade.

1057	3207	Dear Xander, 
1057	3220	The excision specimen of this low grade myxoid lesion remains difficult. I am still uncertain how to classify this hypo-cellular fibro myxoid lesion within fatty tissue. It is essentially circumscribed and includes hyalinised collagenous areas with scattered non atypical spindle shaped cells and interspersed myxoid areas. 
1057	3544	Within the latter are spindle shaped cells but focally are some multi vacuolated lipoblast-like cells. There is some form of vascularity in thestroma but this is not uniform as it typically seen in myxoid liposarcomas. 
1057	3763	Our immunostains show some positivity for S100. Immunostains for Muc-4 and EMA appear negative. 
1057	3859	I am not certain of the diagnosis.Possibilities I considered were a well differentiated liposarcoma with myxoid areas, an unusual myxoid liposarcoma, a chondroid lipoma, a cellular myxoma and a low grade fibro myxoid sarcoma. The negative MUC4 immunostain is against thelatter. The absence of MDM2 amplification on FISH (please see Prof K'Eberling comment below) is against a well differentiated liposarcoma. Further FISH analysis (DDIT3 & FUS) is pending.

1057	4357	Prof Erasmo Greenwaldt comments: 
1057	4390	I agree with Prof Kirby report. I do not have a definite diagnosis for this low grade fibro myxoid tumour. 
1057	4497	A/Prof DEON BALCKWELL comments:  
1057	4530	I agree with Prof Tarka differential for this most unusual myoid tumour. Whilst it is not typical of any of them, I slightly favour an unusual chondroid lipoma but definitely could not exclude a low grade sarcoma. I await FISH analysis results with interest. 
1057	4789	Dr Brittaney Farr comments: 
1057	4817	I agree that this very myxoid neoplasm is difficult to characterise but I think that there are features that are concerning for a myxoid liposarcoma (areas of delicate arborising vessels), "lymphangioma" like spaces secondary to pools of mucin, and agree that FISH for evidence of re-arrangement of DDIT3 might be helpful (as requested by Dr Kolkowski).

1058	1809	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr P Krausz - 20.5.2063) 
1058	1860	The left anterior thigh tumour is a myxoid liposarcoma. The tumour is partially encapsulated and consists of lobules of chondromyxoid stroma containing atypical adipocytes and lipoblasts, a chicken-wire network of thin walled vessels and scattered pseudolymphangioma-like spaces. Broad areas of necrosis (macroscopically involving 20%) and a prominent foreign body type giant cell reaction are present, and may represent effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Two reactive lymph nodes are identified. Sections of the saphenous vein show no significant histologic abnormality. No evidence of round cell component or high grade dedifferentiation is seen. The relationship of tumour to the margins is as follows: 
1058	2563	Margins: 
1058	2572	Posterior margin: Present at margin (Block 8) 
1058	2618	Anterior margin: Less than 0.2mm (Block 7)

1059	356	CLINICAL: 
1059	366	Skin lesion right medial lower leg.  Nil medical.  Recent preop chemo radiotherapy ceased May 2063.  Skin lesion medial right lower leg histopath. 
1059	513	Additional clinical history.   Large sarcoma (biphasic synovial sarcoma).  Margins macroscopically clear.  Histo R thigh mass.  Clarified margins with Dr TEMPEST Brooksher.   
1059	688	MACROSCOPIC: 
1059	701	A.  Specimen labelled "Fresh sarcoma right thigh" consists of an orientated mass including vastus muscles with a suture at one end (superior) measuring 140mmsuperior to inferior, 110mm medial to lateral and 74mm superficial to deep and weighing 318.5g.  The bone margin is inked black, vessel margin red, the rest of posterior green, anterior blue, inferior purple and superior orange.  Thereis an encapsulated bare area on the posterior margin near the bone margin measuring 55 x 25mm which is covered by strips of retracted muscle (due to fixation, Dr Mitchell clarified was covered with 2cm muscle layer prior to excision).   
1059	1330	The tumour measures 110mm superior to inferior, 51mm anterior to posterior and 65mm medial to lateral. The cut surface shows a solid and cystic tumour comprised of pale tan lobulated areas with areas of haemorrhage.  The cystic spacesrange from 4mm to 54mm in maximum dimension.  The cystic areas have a smooth inner lining.  The medial part of the tumour, in particular, has multiple large cysts, together measuring 30 x 54 x 30mm, and these contain blood stained fluid.  The margins are as follows:  cystic tumour abuts the superior and medial margins; cystic tumour 5mm from the posterior margin; solid tumour 12mm from the anterior margin, 30mm from the inferior margin, and 42mm from the lateral margin.Representative in 25 blocks.  See attached diagram. 
1059	2090	Blocks:  1 to 17 - longitudinal full face through tumour; 18 - superior closest margin; 19 to 24 - medial parasagittal full face; 25 - lateral margin.  (Block 9 for tumour bank) 
1059	2268	B.  Specimen labelled "Lesion right leg" consistsof an unoriented ellipse of skin measuring 27 x 10 x 3mm.  There is a nodular pale lesion on the surface of the skin measuring 5 x 5mm.  Representative sections in 2 blocks. 
1059	2491	Blocks:  1- TS through lesion; 2 - LS ends. 
1059	2535	(TO:  AT; JZ/bl 4/7/63) 
1059	2559	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Grenke): 
1059	2598	A.  Sections show a biphasic synovial sarcoma which is partly cystic and partly solid.  Most of the solid component has an appearance similar to the previous core biopsy (19A88853).  This comprises mainly spindle cells in short irregularfascicles and also admixed more epithelioid cells forming palisades and occasional poorly formed gland-like structures. The tumour cells have elongated and oval nuclei with fine chromatin, generally small nucleoli and scanty, poorly defined eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There is also a minor component, around 20% of the tumour sampled, where there is very obvious formation of well formed glands lined by columnar cells, with intervening spindle cell tumour.  The tumour cysts are generally surrounded by a thin rim of solid tumour and are lined by spindled tumour cells.  There are scattered foci of calcification within the tumour.  Mitoses number up toaround 8 per 10 high power fields.  No necrosis is seen.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  There is some patchy collagenous and myxoid fibrosis adjacent to the tumour, particularly inferiorly, and this presumably represents tumour which has now regressed due to chemotherapy.  However this fibrosis is not particularly prominent and all the tumour identified macroscopically appears to be viable histologically.   
1059	3925	No tumour is identified at excision margins.  Tumour is 0.5mm from the superior margin, 1mm from the posterior margin, 3mm from the medial margin, greater than 10mm from anterior margin, 20mm from the lateral margin and well away from the inferior margin.   
1059	4183	Immunostains: 
1059	4197	Cytokeratin AE1/3:   Patchy positive staining.  Strongly positive in well formed glandular component. 
1059	4299	Bcl-2:   Strongly positive. 
1059	4327	Mic-2 (CD 99):   Generally negative. 
1059	4364	Desmin:   Negative. 
1059	4384	Smooth muscle actin:   Negative. 
1059	4417	Ki-67:   Proliferation index estimated 25%. 
1059	4461	The tumour is FNCLCC grade 2 (tumour differentiation score 3, mitosis score 1, necrosis score 0).     
1059	4563	B.  Sections show skin and subcutis.  Within the dermis there is a dermatofibroma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  Excision appears complete.  (ec)  
1059	4718	DIAGNOSIS:   
1059	4731	A.   Right thigh mass:  Biphasic synovial sarcoma.  
1059	4783	B.   Right leg:  Dermatofibroma.  
1059	4817	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (10.7.63): 
1059	4849	A.  The apparently close superior excision margin was discussed with Dr D Sharpnack. 
1059	4934	After viewing a photo of the longitudinal cut surface of the specimen it was realised that muscle anterior and posterior to the tumour had originally been connected superiorly, and that after excision and specimen fixation these muscles had separated and retracted downwards.  The true superior excision margin is therefore considered to be well clear.

1060	6720	REFERRAL:  A, B, C -  PROFESSOR Buddy, Peter Mac, CASINO REPORTS: 
1060	6786	"Many thanks for asking me to look at this young man's masses in the buttock/groin region.  I am returning your original stained slides and the blocks herein.  
1060	6946	As you rightly say, both lesions have similar morphologic features, being characterised by an acinar-type or papillary proliferation of plump epithelioid cells with palely eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm and relatively uniform and only mildly atypical vesicular nuclei.  While some areasof the lesion do indeed bear an architectural resemblance to myxopapillary ependymoma, the bulk of the lesion has much more epithelioid morphology than one would expect in that context.  Immunostains in our hands show strong positivity not only for S100 protein but also for GFAP along with scattered cells positive EMA and rare cells positive for keratin CAM 5.2, while stains for pan keratin, p63, TFE-2 and Olig 2 are negative.  Staining for INI-1 is positive, ie. normal/retained.  I believe that the cytoarchitectural features and immunophenotype would fit best with myoepithelial carcinoma, low grade. The presence of two distinct masses is very worrisome and clearly raises the possibility of this representing metastasis from elsewhere, unless perhaps one of these lesions represents a locoregional metastasis from the other.  Only ongoing clinical correlation will help to address this question.  I would be very interested to hear of future developments in this unusual case".

1061	1205	B.  Specimen labelled "Sarcoma left buttock; stitch 12 o'clock, double deep margin" consists of an excision of skin and subcutaneous tissue 160 x 95 x 90mm.  The deep margin is inked black, the 3 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 9o'clock margin green.  The ellipse of skin measures 140 x 45mm.  There is a central polypoid appearing area with oversewn gauze which measures 40 x 20mm which appears to correspond to the previous excision site.  At the 9 o'clock edge of the skin there is an excision which measures 100mm which has been re-sutured.  The cut surface reveals a soft cream and slightly haemorrhagic tumour which measures 45 x 40 x 45mm.  There is an adjacent cavity noted at the 9 o'clock marginwhich measures 40 x 60 x 70mm.  There is a portion of tumour that appears to communicate with the skin.  The tumour appears to abut the deep margin.  The tumour is 3mm from the 3 o'clock margin, 50mm from the 9 o'clock margin, 10mm from the 12 o'clock margin and well clear of the 6o'clock margin.

(NM/cc 3/5/63) 
1061	2822	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Ingram):  
1061	2862	A &B.  Sections show a relatively well circumscribed tumour within deep soft tissue.  The tumour comprises of a mixture of spindle cells, round to oval cells and multinucleated giant cells.  There is marked cytological atypia and nuclear pleomorphism.  There is brisk mitotic activity.  Focal areas of prominent stromal hyalinisation and coagulative necrosis are present.  Numerous tumour giant cells are present throughout the tumour.  Some of the giant cells are osteoclastic-like.  The tumour infiltrates into the surrounding adipose tissue.  No definite vascular invasion is seen.  There is a cavity adjacent to the tumour, which is in keeping with previous surgery.  The overall appearances are similar to those described in the previous pathology report (WHYALLA HOSPITAL Hospital, DICKINSON 2 SOUTH, CY-11-113968).  The appearances are consistent with those of undifferentiated high grade sarcoma with giant cells.  The tumour is completely excised.  The tumour is 5.5mm to the deep margin (block B2) and is 4mm to the 3 o'clock soft tissue margin (block B4).  The other margins are well clear. 
1061	3964	C.  Sections show fibrofatty tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

1062	322	Chondrosarcoma left anterolateral chest wall, ribs 8, 9, 10; - short suture superior (rib 8), long lateral, medium medial, double on diaphragm insertion. 
1062	476	MACROSCOPIC: 
1062	489	Specimen labelled "Sarcoma left chest wall; short superior, medium medial, double stitch diaphragm" consists of three ribs with a large tumour mass and overlying subcutaneous tissue and skin.  There are four sutures for orientation as above.  The specimen measures 160mm (medial-lateral) x 110mm (superficial-deep) x 100mm (superior-inferior).  The overlying ellipse of skin measures 180 x 80mm with a thickness of 50mm.  Rib 8 measures 120mm in length and 12mm in thickness.  Rib 9 measures 130mm in length and 10mm in thickness.  Rib 10 measures approximately 130mm in length and 10mm in thickness.  The superior margin of the specimen is inkedblue, the inferior margin black and the diaphragm insertion green.  
1062	1203	At the posterior surface of the ribs there is a large, apparently partly cystic tumour measuring 90mm (medial-lateral) x 70mm (superior-inferior) x 70mm (superficial-deep).  The posterior margin of the tumour is partly covered by fascia and adipose tissue.  Macroscopically the tumour is 10mm from the superior margin, 40mm from the medial margin, 20mm from the lateral margin and <5mm from the inferior margin .  On sectioning, the tumour has a variegated appearance with multiple cysts filled with gelatinous haemorrhagic material, areas of necrosis and areas of haemorrhage.  There are solid glistening areas of tumour identified centrally in the mass.  The middle of the three ribs (rib 9) extends into the mass and is partly destroyed.  Ribs 8 and 10 abut the mass but do not appear to be involved by tumour macroscopically.  Representative sections are taken. 
1062	2069	Blocks:  1 - shave of ribs medial margin; 2 - shave of lateral margin rib 8; 3 - shave of lateral margin rib 9; 4 - shave of lateral margin rib 10; 5 to 11 - one full face of tumour with rib 9 and 10; 12 - rib 8 transverse section attached to tumour; 13 & 14 - two representative sections of superior margin with tumour; 15 - representative section of tumour with superficial-inferior margin; 16 - representative section of tumour with inferior margin; 17 - tumour with inferior margin; 18 - tumour with diaphragmatic margin; 19 - tumour with diaphragmatic margin; 20 - tumour with posterosuperior margin; 21 - posteroinferior margin; 22 - one longitudinal section of intercostal muscle with tumour between ribs 9 and10 (blocks 6 & 7 - reserved blocks).   (PG/cc 28/5/63)  
1062	2844	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Nedman): 
1062	2883	Sections show a moderately differentiated (grade 2) chondrosarcoma, apparently arising fromthe 9th rib.  The tumour consists of cartilage with a moderate increase in cellularity and the chondrocyte nuclei show moderate pleomorphism, atypia and hyperchromasia.  Binucleate chondrocytes are noted.  Much of the central tumour is necrotic and this is what gave the macroscopic impression of central cystic change.  The tumour invades into skeletal muscleand other soft tissues of the chest wall with a lobulated, pushing margin.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  Mitoses are infrequent.  In the sections the 9th rib is completely replaced by tumour and the 8th rib is also partly involved by tumour (block 10).  Some pleura is noted on the deep surface of the mass and this shows non-specificreactive mesothelial proliferation.  No pleural invasion by tumour is seen.   
1062	3774	All soft tissue and bone excision margins appear to be free of tumour.  Tumour is 2mm from the nearest superior soft tissue excision margin, 1.3mm from the nearest inferior soft tissue margin and 4mm from the nearest diaphragmatic soft tissue margin.  Medial, lateral and anterior soft tissue margins are well clear.  Tumour is 2mm from the nearest diaphragmatic pleural surface and 4mm from the nearest posterior pleural surface.

1066	1921	Tumour cells negative for: Pan-cytokeratin, Melan-A, HMB45, CAM5.2, C-KIT, CD31, CD34, SMA, Desmin, ALK-1 and CD21. 
1066	2037	LCA highlights numerous inflammatory cells in the background. 
1066	2099	S100 shows patchy granular cytoplasmic positivity of uncertain significance.  
1066	2177	A ki-67 proliferative index highlights approximately 75% of tumour cell nuclei. 
1066	2257	COMMENT: 
1066	2266	The peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours are malignant spindle cell and epithelioid tumours, respectively. Both tumours have a similar pattern of immunohistochemical staining, and the overall appearance is similar to the retroperitoneal high grade epithelioid and spindle cell sarcoma previously described in the pathology slide review from South Africa in 2057 (51G89448YRC Worldwide). These peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours most likely represent a spectrum of morphological atypia within a high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Although no lipoblasts are seen, it is possible that these tumours represent foci of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which could be confirmed with FISH testing for MDM2 amplification.  
1066	3008	There is focal S100 staining in the intra-abdominal tumour, and although additional markers of melanoma such as HMB45 and Melan-A are negative and melanoma is considered less likely, the possibility that this tumour represents metastatic malignant melanoma cannot be entirely excluded.  
1066	3295	There is no significant staining with markers of epithelial, smooth muscle or skeletal muscle differentiation, no evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma is seen.  
1066	3457	Please correlate with clinical, imaging and histopathology findings.  
1066	3527	Representative slides seen with Dr N Jemenez.  
1066	3575	DIAGNOSIS: 
1066	3586	A & B.  Peritoneal and intra-abdominal tumours: Malignant spindled and high grade epithelioidtumours, favour high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma ?dedifferentiated liposarcoma (please see comment).

1066	4122	Comment: 
1066	4131	Only 5 metaphases were obtained. The karyotype could not be determined due to the complexity and poor quality of the metaphases obtained. However, double minute chromosomes were observed, which is a cytogenetic hallmark of gene amplification. FISH for MDM2 showed a signal pattern, consistent with amplified MDM2. This is a feature of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Please correlate with other findings and contact the laboratory if FISH should be repeated on paraffin tissue from the tumour.

1067	174	MACROSCOPIC: 
1067	187	Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a wedge of liver unorientated measuring 70 x 60 x 50mm.  The surgical margin is dusky and irregular.  On the serosal surface there is an area of puckering measuring 30 x 20mm.  The surgical margin is inked blue.  On sectioning in the area of serosal puckering there is a solid white and nodular tumour measuring 30 x 20 x 28mm.  It is located 8mm away from the closest surgical margin.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.   
1067	668	Blocks:  1 - tumour close to the surgical margin; 2 to 4 - representative tumour; 5 - tumour for tissue bank; 6 - one representative section away from the tumour.   
1067	833	(LB/mm 25.9.62)  
1067	850	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr B Harrod): 
1067	889	Sections show a 30mm deposit of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, in keeping with colorectal origin.  The lesion has a complex glandular architecture and is composed of columnar to polygonal tumour cells with pleomorphic nuclei.  Large areas of necrosis are seen.  The lesion is 8mm from the liver resection margin.  There is no evidence of surface serosal involvement. 
1067	1278	In the adjacent liver there is focal bridging fibrosis (block 11) associated with a hepatocyte entrapment.  Areas of hyperplasia with atrophy in the periphery are seen on reticulin staining, possibly representing nodular regenerative hyperplasia. Mild macrovesicular steatosis and focal minimal iron deposition (on Perl stain) are present in the hepatocytes. No copper binding proteins are seen on Rhodamine and orcein stains.

1068	615	MACROSCOPIC: 
1068	628	A.  Specimen labelled "Abdominal sarcoma" consists of en bloc resection of left kidney, 95 x 60 x 47mm, segment of descending colon, 210mm in length and 35mm in diameter and attached nodular large firm mass measuring 185 x 130 x 100mm.  The kidney has a smooth external surface and is continuity with a long segment of ureter with a catheter in place, 150mm in length and 7mm in diameter.  The large bowel shows no unusual features.  The tumour appears nodular and is situated within the pericolic fat and focally firmly attached to the ureter.  The anterior aspect of the tumour inked blue, the lateral black and the posterior (deep) green.  Posteriorly and along the ureter the specimen is longitudinally disrupted (inked red).  The tumour appears firmly attached to the ureter over a length of 50mm which lies approximately 45mm from pelvis.  Sectioning through the tumour shows a solid, cream pale tan cut surface with areas of necrosis (<10%) and myxoid areas.  The tumour seems to abut all resection margins in multiple areas.  The kidney shows no unusual features on sectioning.   
1068	1716	Blocks:  1 - proximal margin of colon; 2- distal margin of colon; 3 & 4 - kidney; 5 - ureteric margin and ureteropelvic junction; 6 - tumour superior margin; 7 - inferior tumour; 8 & 9 - anterior tumour; 10 - medial tumour; 11 - lateral tumour; 12 to 16 - tumour adherent to ureter; 17 - tumour anterior colic fat; 18 to 20 - pericolic fat with possible lymph nodes; 21 - random; 22 - reserved block.  Fresh tissue was taken for cytogenetics.   
1068	2162	B.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel resection" consists of a segment of stapled small bowel, 140mm in length, 22mm in diameter with attached mesentery up to 28mm in width.  The serosal surface appears congested and focally is ragged over an area of approximately 15mm across.  The mucosa shows no unusual features.   
1068	2478	Blocks:  1- margins; 2 & 3 - LS full thickness with abnormal serosa; 4 & 5 - mesentery. 
1068	2566	C.  Specimen labelled"Aorta" consists of a piece of irregularly shaped greyish tissue with attached blood clot measuring 5 x 3 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.  
1068	2714	(TO:  KJ; KJ/mm 17.1.62)  
1068	2740	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by DrP Eggett): 
1068	2780	A.  Sections show a large retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma which measures approximately 185 x 130 x 100mm.  The sarcoma has previously been classified as grade 2 using the FNCLCC system (tumour differentiation -1, mitotic count -3, tumour necrosis -0 - total score of 4). The resected tumour shows an estimated 10% tumour necrosis and prominent mitotic activity (greater than 20 per 10 hpf) as well as marked pleomorphism of the spindle cells (this is interpreted as a poor response to radiotherapy).   
1068	3281	The deep and superior margins of resection appear positive and the inferior margin is less than 0.1mm clear.  The anterior margin is 0.2mm clear and the lateral margin 0.1mm clear.  The medial margin is estimated at 5mm clearance.  The tumour invades the muscularis of the left ureter and almost reaches the lining urothelium. The tumour also invades the mesentery of the descending colon but does not directly invade this segment of large bowel.  The kidney also is not invaded by tumour and appears normal.  The small pericolic lymph nodes identified are negative for tumour.  
1068	3860	B.  The peritoneal surfaceof the small bowel shows focal small deposits of  leiomyosarcoma. These measure 0.5-1mm in maximal dimension.   
1068	3998	C.  Sections show fibrofatty adventitia and clot. There is no tumour present.  (ec)

1070	2170	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Shoen):  
1070	2209	A.  Sections of the cervix show a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of endocervical-type.  The tumour partly has a papillary and glandular architecture but there is also a significant poorly differentiated component, consisting of trabeculae of cells with large nuclei, abundant cytoplasm and showing minimal gland formation.  Tumour involves the full circumference of the cervix and invades deeply into cervical stroma, and also extensively involves endometrium and invades into myometrium.  Maximum depth of cervical stromal invasion measures 10mm out of total stromal thickness of 14mm.   Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is measured at 12mm where total myometrial thickness is 16mm (block A24).  There is lymphovascular invasion at least focally in the myometrium (block A15).  Part of the tumour invading myometrium has a mucinous (colloid) appearance.   
1070	3076	Tumour cells involving the surface lining of thecervix, and also focal invasive carcinoma (block A6), extend to the ectocervical excision margin.  No squamous epithelium is seen on the ectocervix or at the ectocervical margin.

Within part of the blood and thrombus there are sheets of reactive mesothelial cells with associated small groups of malignant epithelial cells.  No definite tumour is seen within the intact tissue.  Sections of the left adnexa show markedly haemorrhagic tissue but no tumour is identified.   
1084	3865	C.  Sections of the mass show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with a metastasis from colon.  There are variable sized irregular cystic spaces lined by columnar epithelial cells.  There is prominent, patchy dirty necrosis.  Mucus is also noted within the cysts and within the necrotic tissue.  No normal ovary is identified.  Tumour is noted extending into adjacent fibrofat.  In one section there is apparent attached muscularis propria of intestinal wall and tumour abuts the outer aspect of this tissue.  Sections of the right fallopian tube show focal tumour attached to the fimbrial end of the tube but the tube is otherwise unremarkable.    
1084	4530	Immunostains for mismatch repair enzymes will be performed as requested and a supplementary report issued.   
1084	4639	D.  Sections show fibrofat with patchy deposits of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, similar to that seen in specimens A and C.  Muscularis propria of intestinal wall is identified attached at one edge of the tissue; tumour abuts the outer aspect of this tissue.  (ec)

1084	6430	POSITIVE 
1084	6439	MUTATION DETECTED: KRAS Codonl2/13 
1084	6475	Interpretation: 
1084	6491	The tumour sample from Joaquina VINEGAR CARRIES a known activating KRAS gene mutation that affects codon 12/13 of the KRAS protein. 
1084	6623	This patient is NOT expected benefit from treatment with an EGFR antagonist based therapy. 
1084	6714	(Lievre et al. KRAS mutation status is predictive of response to cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer, Cancer Res 2006;66:3992-5).  
1084	6848	METHOD: 
1084	6856	* DNA was extracted from FFPE tumour tissue using the Roche cobas DNA Sample Preparation kit. 
1084	6950	* KRAS gene mutations were analyzed using the Roche cobas KRAS Mutation Test kit (ARTG: 118368). 
1084	7047	COMMENTS: 
1084	7057	* Thisis intended as an adjunct to other prognostic and predictive factors to aid clinical treatment decisions. 
1084	7169	* This test detects the presence of KRAS gene mutations affecting codons 12/13 or 61 of the KRAS protein, but does not specifythe KRAS gene mutation detected. Other mutations, either in the KRAS gene or in other genes, will NOT be detected by this analysis.  
1084	7428	* This test has been shown in our laboratory to detect at least 5% mutant KRAS alleles in a background of normal DNA.  
1084	7547	* The analytical sensitivity and specificity of this test are 99.5% and 99%, respectively. PCR inhibitors or rare mutations affecting the binding sites of PCR primers used in this assay may cause a false negative result. 
1084	7768	* This test has been processed as a Level 1 genetic test according to the NPAAC guidelines (2007).

1086	1250	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Haros & Dr S Debbins): 
1086	1303	A & B.  Sections show omentum infiltrated by a diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cells.  No follicle formation is seen.  The atypical cells are small to medium sized with often clearcytoplasm.  The nuclei are cleaved with vesicular chromatin and occasional small nucleoli.  Frequent mitoses are identified. 
1086	1619	The atypical lymphoid cells show strong positive staining with LCA, CD20, Bcl2 and CD10.  There is moderate staining with cyclin-D1 and CD43.  The cells are negative for CD23.  The CD21 highlights dendritic cells and the CD3 and CD5 stains highlight admixed T-lymphocytes.  The Ki67 proliferation index is approximately 70%. 
1086	1944	COMMENT:  The morphological features are consistent with a small B-cell non- Hodgkin lymphoma with the cyclin-D1 positivity suggestive of mantle cell lymphoma.  Due the negative CD5 and positive CD10 stains, tissue will be sent for FISH studies.

1086	2585	Interphase FISH detected no evidence of juxtaposition of IGH@ and CCND1 loci, and therefore no evidenceof t(11;14)(q13;q32) in this tissue.  Two copies of both IGH@ and CCND1 were seen in the majority of nuclei, although some very large nuclei were seen with multiple copies of each locus.  
1086	2876	Summary:  
1086	2886	No evidence of IGH@CCND1 rearrangement".  
1086	2928	Note:  In light of the FISH result, the lymphoma would be best regarded as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

24	4193	The existence of ER -ve, PR +ve cancer has been disputed in the literature. Some authors suggest positive PR staining in this context may be due to non-specific binding by PR antibody (De Maeyer et al,, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):335-6 and Hefti at al., Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R68). 
24	4490	Furthermore the morphology and positive CK5/6 staining in the lesion would favour a triple-negative basal phenotype.

353	338	Recurrent haemopericytoma left thigh.(small piece for cytogenetics).    
353	410	MACROSCOPIC: 
353	423	A.  Specimen labelled "Lesion left thigh suture 12 o'clock" consists of a piece of fatty tissue with overlying skin and one suture for orientation 12 o'clock measuring 120mm from 12 to 6 o'clock and 50mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 60mm (superficial to deep) margin.  The ellipse of overlying skin measures 80mm from 12 to 6 o'clock and 20mm from 3 to 9 o'clock.  The surface of the skin is unremarkable.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked black, 9 o'clock margin blue, deep margin purple.  Specimen is serially sectioned from 12 to 6 o'clock into fourteen slices.  Slice one 12 o'clock, slice fourteen 6 o'clock.  On sectioning and in slices five to eight there is a well circumscribed possibly encapsulated solid mass measuring 40mm (superficial to deep) margin and 30mm from 3 to 9 o'clock, 25mm from 12 to 6 o'clock.  The cut surface of the tumour is solid and tanned with tiny areas of haemorrhage.  The tumour is located less than 1mm to the 9 o'clock margin (slice six) and more than 5mm from the 3 o'clock margin (slice six).  (Slice seven shows tumour with no margins).  The rest of the tissue is unremarkable.  Representative sections taken according to the diagram.   
353	1594	Blocks: 1 - one LS 12 o'clock margin; 2 to 7 - slice five; 8 to 10 - representative sections of the tumour from slice six; 11 to 13 - tumour from slice seven; 14 & 15 - tumour from slice eight; 16 - one LS 6 o'clock margin.   
353	1820	B.  Specimen labelled "New deep margin left thighmass, one single suture 12  o'clock, double suture deep" consists of a membranouspiece of tissue with one suture 12 o'clock and a suture deep.  The margin with the purple suture is covered by fat.  The opposite margin appears to be facia.  The deep margin inked blue, the opposite margin black.  Specimen is AE from 12 to 6 o'clock in 5 blocks.    
353	2217	(HZ/ta 23/5/63)  
353	2234	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Delarosa): 
353	2275	A.  The 40mm tumouris a solitary fibrous tumour with a multinodular configuration.  The closely opposed  tumour nodules are circumscribed,  thinly encapsulated and composed of moderately cellular spindle cells arranged haphazardly, in storiform arrays andin short fascicles.  Numerous ectatic haemangiopericytomatous vessels are present and there are foci of stromal myxoid alteration and foci of fibrosis.  The mildly pleomorphic tumour cells are spindled with pointed ends, ill defined cytoplasmic borders, pale granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.  Mitoses are easily identified and number up to 8 per 10 hpf and there is focal central coagulative necrosis, which may however relate to previous core biopsy sampling. The tumour is mostly surrounded by unremarkable mature adipose tissue, however, focally the thin fibrous pseudocapsule forms the margin of the specimen at 9 o'clock (<0.1mm clear) (A14). The 3 o'clock margin is 1mm cleartowards the deep margin (A10) and the true deep margin is 6mm clear (A10) The 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins are well clear.  No scar tissue is seen in the overlying subcutis and dermis or adjacent adipose tissue 
353	3440	Immunohistochemistry:  
353	3463	The tumour cells stain as follows: 
353	3498	Positive:  CD34, BCL-2, CD99, EMA (patchy weak) 
353	3546	Negative: SMA, Desmin, S100, Melan A, HMB45, CK19. 
353	3597	The Ki67 proliferation index is approximately 5-10%. 
353	3650	COMMENT: 
353	3659	The morphological appearances and immunoprofile are consistent with a solitary fibrous tumour.  Haemangiopericytoma is a less specific term, used in older literature, that described tumours that would currently be classified as solitary fibrous tumours, as well as, several other soft tissue neoplasms with similar staghorn vasculature.   Although histological features do not reliably predict behaviour in solitary fibrous tumours, the presence in this case of increased mitotic activity (8 per 10 hpf), possible tumour related coagulative necrosis and areas of moderate cellularity are findings associated with more aggressive (malignant) behaviour. The tumour, however, lacks other features associated with malignancy such as infiltrative borders and significant nuclear pleomorphism.  
353	4448	B.  Sections show mature fibroadiposetissue and a small portion of skeletal muscle. There is no evidence of tumour.   
353	4566	DIAGNOSIS:   
353	4579	A.   Lesion left thigh (recurrent): 
353	4615	-     Solitary fibrous tumour with atypical features (see comment)

353	5332	Comment: 
353	5341	An abnormal clone with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 14 was detected. Karyotypes with simple balanced translocations have been reported as a feature of some published haemangiopericytomas, but no recurrent translocation isdescribed. A breakpoint in 12q is a feature of some cases, but was not observed in this case. These results are consistent with, but not diagnostic for, haemangiopericytoma.

563	665	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr U Vigueras): 
563	706	A.  Sections show a variably cellular circumscribed spindle cell tumour containing focal areas of myxoid change.  A very small number of thick walled blood vessels are present within the tumour with the cells arranged in vague interdigitating fascicles.  The cells have indistinct eosinophilic cytoplasm with bland oval nuclei, fine chromatin andoccasional small nucleoli.  No areas of necrosis are seen.  Occasional mitosis are seen (approximately 5 per 10 high power field) and the Ki-67 index is focally up to 5%.

563	1409	COMMENT: 
563	1418	The morphology and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with a neural tumour.  Thepossibilities include a solitary circumscribed neuroma (palisaded encapsulated neuroma) and schwannoma, although the very weak staining with S100 and increased mitotic activity are unusual.

563	2138	The slides were reviewed by Dr PEARL Beskom, Dr U Stauss, Dr U Sandhaus and myself without a definite consensus diagnosis being reached. The positive neurofilament stain (NF6S), however, would support a cellular neurofibroma with atypia. The mitoses, up to 3mm/2. would support low grade malignancy for this tumour which is composed of poorly defined bundles of small spindle cells. The proliferation index - up to 10% nuclei positive with Ki67 could also fit a low grade malignancy.

583	279	AMENDED REPORT (27.4.63) 
583	305	The following report replaces the originally issued report. In the original report it was stated that no lymph nodes were identified in the perithymic adipose tissue.  This was written in error.  There were in fact two negative lymph nodes.  The diagnosis remains unchanged.  The report has been corrected and is as follows: 
583	630	CLINICAL: 
583	640	Anterior mediastinal tumour,  
583	670	?thymoma.  Anterior mediastinal tumour lymph node (left phrenic nerve). 
583	743	Further information from Dr Busie: 
583	778	Intraoperatively the mediastinal tumour appeared circumscribed with no apparent attachment to neighbouring structures including the pericardium. 
583	923	MACROSCOPIC: 
583	936	Specimen labelled "Mediastinal tumour" consists of a unoriented piece of encapsulated firm tan tissue measuring 75 x 60 x 40mm with loosely attached fat measuring 80 x 50mm with a separate portion of fat attached included measuring 70 x 60mm.  The specimen weighs 132.7g. The external surface of the specimen is inked blue.  On sectioning the tissue reveals a variegated surface with pink fleshy areas and areas which appear haemorrhagic.  The external surface is nodular but appears covered by a variably well defined capsule.  The tumour appears to abut the surgical margin focally. 
583	1521	Blocks:  1 to 4 - composite sets and represent a full thickness section through the centre of the tumour; 5 to 10 - representative section of tumour; 11 - six possible lymph nodes; 12 - ?  possible lymph nodes in loosely attached fat; 13 - one possible lymph node in loosely attached fat; 14 to19 further representative sections of tumour with capsule  (14 & 15, 16 & 17, 18 & 19 - composites); 20 to 23 - further representative section of tumour including  margins..  
583	1990	B.  Specimen labelled "Mediastinal lymph node" consists of a lymph node measuring 25 x 15mm.  Specimen is longitudinally bisected and AE 2 blocks. 
583	2137	(TT/bl 15/4/63) 
583	2153	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Ravo): 
583	2190	A.  Sections show the75mm tumour is a microinvasive thymoma which is difficult to morphologically sub-classify.   The mostly encapsulated tumour shows some organotypical features with angulated, mostly acellular, fibrous bands separating large lobules and sheets of tumour cells and there are some perivascular spaces.  Much of the tumour has a WHO type A morphology and comprises relatively bland spindle cells arranged in sheets, trabeculae with some micro-glandular/micro-cystic areas. Pericellular reticulin is demonstrated in these areas.  Round to polygonal epithelioid cells arranged in rosette-like structures are also present and compatible with type A morphology.  Alesser but significant component displays micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma features with interconnected  nests of bland epithelioid cells and scant admixed lymphocytes separated by lymphoid rich stroma containing scattered lymphoidfollicles but no admixed epithelial cells.  There are multiple foci of definite capsular invasion (eg. Block A5, block A19) into adjacent mediastinal adipose tissue/thymic adipose tissue and no neighbouring mediastinal structures are present.  The invasive foci are predominately smooth contoured nodules with a micronodular thymoma and lymphoid rich stroma appearance. However, in some areas, the type A areas transitions to a minor component, including extracapsular tumour, that shows a sheet-like arrangement of spindled to polygonal with at least mild atypia including irregular grooved nuclei, vesicular chromatin, conspicuous nucleoli and easily identified tumour cell mitoses (numbering up to 5 /10 HPF) (Block A10).  Focal lymphovascular invasion is present within the capsule of the tumour (Block A9).  No perineural invasion is seen.  The invasive tumour focally reaches the inked surgical resection margin (Block A 21, Block A6) and these areas show micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma morphology.  The capsule of the tumour also forms the margin of resection across a broad front.   No evidence of thymic carcinoma is seen.  No lymph nodes are identified in the loosely attached adipose tissue, however, a separate nodule of type A thymoma is present,  presumably microinvasive tumour,  is present here (Block A11). Two lymph nodes, present in theperithymic adipose tissue, show reactive sinus histiocytosis but no evidence of malignancy. 
583	4564	Immunohistochemistry 
583	4585	Immunohistochemical stains confirm that the type A areas show relatively sparse mature CD3 and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with no immature T lymphocytes (CD1a, CD99 and TdT negative) and scattered CD20 positive B cells.  Scattered dendritic cells, including Langerhans cells (CD1a andS100 positive) are also present.  The micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma areas show restricted keratin (AE1/AE3) expression within the epithelial areas and  no keratin positive cells within the intervening lymphoid stroma. The lymphoid stroma predominantly comprises mixed mature T cells (CD3 and CD5 positive) and CD20 positive B cells.  There is also an admixed immature T cells (CD1a, TdT and CD99) component which show accentuated distribution around the peripheral aspects of the epithelial nests.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is low within the bland type A spindle cells areas and  significantly higher within areas showing nuclear atypia (Block A10).  The CD117 stains scattered cells within the epithelial component, possibly admixed mast cells, however, no sheet like pattern of positive staining is seen.  The CD5 stain appears to correspond to the CD3 stain, highlighting T cells, without obvious CD5 expression within the epithelial cells. 
583	5831	COMMENT: 
583	5840	The invasive thymoma is difficult to subclassify.  The tumour shows definite WHO type A areas and separate micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma areas. By definition these subtypes lack nuclear atypia.  However, the type A tumour appears to transition to foci showing at least mild nuclear atypia and tumour cell mitoses. These areas don't quite correspond to typical B3 morphology of the WHO classification, as there are no squamoid features or raisinoid nuclear morphology.  I am not sure if these foci represent the WHO spindle cell variant of B3 subtype.  According to the Suster Moran classification of thymomas, which divides thymomas into well differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated grading categories, and in which the poorly differentiated subtype corresponds to thymic carcinoma, the presence of cellular atypia and mitoses in this tumour warrants classification as a moderately differentiated thymoma (atypical thymoma).   I will seek a second opinion from Prof. Z. Werblow at MOUNT PLEASANT HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementaryreport will be issued.    
583	6939	B.  Sections show one (1) lymph node with reactive sinus histiocytosis and anthrasilicosis.  No evidence of metastatic tumour seen.

583	7791	MICROSCOPIC REPORT: 
583	7811	I agree with your diagnosis of a thymoma with numerous foci of microscopic capsular invasion.  Subclassifing thymomas is somewhat subjective and some cases don't fit neatly into different diagnostic categories.  I favour this tumour being a type A thvmoma (with areas of micronodular thvmoma with a lvmphoid stroma).  Although there are occasional mitoses in areas, the morphology is still similar to other areas and in my opinion, no convincing areas of type B3 thymoma are seen.  The significance of the focally increased mitotic activity and Ki-67 proliferative index is uncertain. 
583	8396	There is no thymic carcinoma present.

59	316	CLINICAL: 
59	326	E/O soft tissue tumour.  ?Liposarcoma right adductor compartment.  Sent with deep and superficial margins additional to main specimen.   Double suture deep.  Single suture superior.   
59	510	MACROSCOPIC: 
59	523	A.  Specimen labelled "Lesion right thigh" and consists of an encapsulated mass received in the fresh state measuring 160 x 120 x 70mm and weighing 676.1g.  The specimen was oriented by the surgical registrar with the double suture representing the deep margin and the single suture the superior margin.  The capsule over the deep/posterior margin was disrupted at surgery and was subsequently repaired.  The fresh specimen was sampled for cytogenetics aswell as tissue banking.  The superficial margin is inked blue, deep black and medial green.  The specimen is transversely sectioned from superior to inferior into 16 consecutive slices.  The cut surface shows predominantly firm, homogeneous fatty tissue but there are a few focal myxoid areas.     
59	1276	Representative sections in 24blocks.  
59	1314	Blocks: 1 to 3 - superior margin; 4 to 6 - lateral margin; 7 to 9 - medial margin; 10 to 12 - superficial margin; 13 to 15 - deep margin; 16 to 19 - inferior margin; 20 to 24 - representative myxoid areas; reselect - 25 - extra block.  
59	1550	B.  Specimen labelled "Deep margin lesion right thigh" consists of lobulated piece of fatty tissue measuring 23 x 12 x 10mm.  The cut surface shows predominantly fatty tissue.  AE 2 blocks. 
59	1743	C.  Specimen labelled "Superior margin lesion thigh" consists of an irregular and flattened piece of fatty tissue measuring 55 x 33 x 8mm.  The cut surface shows predominantly fatty tissue with scattered blood vessels.  AE 6 Blocks. 
59	1976	(QM/ta  6.12.62)  
59	1994	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Feusier): 
59	2034	A.   Sections show a fatty tumour which appears circumscribed.  It consists of sheets and also some lobules of adipocytes, with some intervening bands of dense fibrous tissue.  The tumour has been extensively sampled.  There is moderate variability in size and shape of adipocytes but no lipoblasts are identified and no atypical cells areidentified in the fibrous bands or elsewhere.  There are no histologic features to suggest malignancy.  The tumour appeared well circumscribed macroscopically but histologically itabuts excision margins.  Adequacy of excision is difficult to assess.  Focally at the edge of the tumour there may be some extension into adjacent skeletal muscle (blocks O5, O5); this is a feature described in intramuscular lipomas.   
59	2789	I favour a diagnosis of intramuscular lipoma rather than atypical lipomatous tumour.  A tissue block will be sent to WARIALDA MULTIPURPOSE SERVICE's Hospital for FISH to look for MDM2 amplification; such amplification is identifiable in most atypical lipomatous tumours/ well differentiated lipoma-like liposarcomas, but is absent in benign tumours (Sirvent et al. Am J Surg Pathol 2007; 31:1476-89).  A supplementary report will be issued. 
59	3230	The histologic features do not fit for a hibernoma. 
59	3282	B.  Sections show fat, skeletal muscle and some fibrous tissue.  No definite abnormality is seen.   
59	3382	C.  Sections show fat and fibrous fascial tissue.  No definite abnormality is seen. (ec)  
59	3472	DIAGNOSIS:   
59	3485	A.  Right thigh mass:  Fatty tumour, favour intramuscular lipoma, see text.  Supplementary report to follow.  
59	3595	B.  Deep margin right thigh mass:  No definite abnormality.  
59	3656	C.  Superior margin thigh mass:  No definite abnormality.  
59	3715	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (28.6.62): 
59	3747	Interphase FISH showed a normal signal pattern for MDM2 and D12Z3.  There was no evidence of MDM2 amplification. 
59	3860	Reported by R. Patrice/Dr O Weynand, EMERGENCY's Pathology. 
59	3920	Conventional cytogenetics detected an abnormal clone with apparent reciprocal translocations between chromosomes 7p and 11p, and 11q, 13q and 17p.  There was no loss of material evident.  There were no diagnostic features, and no evidence of a chromosome 12 abnormality was seen. 
59	4200	Reported by R. Tarka/Dr O. Songer, StVincent's Pathology.  
59	4259	There are therefore no features on FISH or cytogenetics to suggest that this is an atypical lipomatous tumour/well differentiated liposarcoma.

637	404	MACROSCOPIC: 
637	417	Specimen labelled "Left groin mass medial stitch 9 o'clock, long stitch 3 o'clock, short stitch superior" consists of a large tumorous mass with  three sutures for orientation and long suture marking the 9 o'clock margin.  The medium suture marking the 3 o'clock margin and a short suture marking the superior margin.  The specimen measures 60mm 3 to 9 o'clock, 110mm superficial to deep and 80mm superior to inferior.  Specimen is inked:blue the 3 o'clock margin, black the 9 o'clock margin and red the superior margin.  The specimen is serially sectioned from superficial to deep margin into ten slices.  Slice one superficial margin.  Slice ten deep margin.  
637	1079	On sectioning the cut surface has  a variegated appearance with fatty tissue looking areas  and areas with more solid yellow/pink  appearance and  haemorrhage.  In slices six, seven and eight the tumour has a more lobulated appearance with thick fibrous bands.  Macroscopically, the tumour abuts the superior margin (in slice number six) and the 9 o'clock margin (slice seven).  Areas of bonyconsistency are also identified.   
637	1506	Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram. 
637	1575	Blocks:  1 & 2 - two sections of superficial margin; 3 to 7 - full face of slice number three; 8 to 12 - slice number five; 13 to 15 - representative sections slice six; 16 to 22 - slice eight; 23 to 25 - two representative sections of slice number 10 (deep margin).

637	1914	(TO: HN; TY/rt 19.3.64) 
637	1938	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Bedney): 
637	1977	Sections of the tumour show similar appearances to that seen inthe previously excised left colon tumour (24O65140). It has a lobulated contour and is composed of pleomorphic malignant spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells. In most areas, these malignant cells appear to be haphazardly arrangedwhile whorled structures are seen in other areas. Scattered foci of osteosarcomatous component are present (Block 17). The surrounding fatty tissue show adipocytic cells with mild size variation in which atypical hyperchromatic cells are seen in the stroma of their fibrocollagenous septae. The aggregate of features is consistent with that of a malignant sarcoma with a dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising from a well differentiated sclerosing type liposarcoma being favoured.  
637	2756	The dedifferentiated component is present at the inferior margin (Block 12) and appears clear of all the other margins. 
637	2876	The well-differentiated component is present at the superficial (Block 2), 3 o'clock (Block 6)and superior (Blocks 8 and 14) margins. 
637	3010	MDM2 amplification study may be helpful.

639	3797	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr L Ngoun): 
639	3835	A.  Sections show a high grade endometrial carcinoma consisting predominately of sheets of tumour cells with pleomorphic nuclei containing vesicular chromatin and occasional prominent nucleoli.  Numerous multinucleated forms with occasional bizarre nuclear pleomorphism are seen.  Extensive mitoses and necrosis are present.  Focally admixed with the high grade tumour are deposits of endometrioid adenocarcinoma showing focal squamous differentiation.  Extensive carcinoma in situ is also present of both endometrioid and serous type.  The tumour mainly forms an exophytic mass on the anterior wall of the uterus however, tumour invades to a depth of 10mm through a wall thickness of 16mm.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The endocervix is uninvolved and the ectocervix shows ulceration consistent with prolapse.  The overall features are that of a predominately anaplastic/undifferentiated carcinoma with focal endometrioid and serous components.  The remainder of the uterus shows multiple calcified leiomyomas.    
639	4862	Sections of the right ovary show a smallfocus of serous adenocarcinoma contained within a lymphatic within the parovarian soft tissue.

The uterus measures 62 x 37 x 20mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 20 x 18mm and has an unremarkable surface.  The endometrium has an irregular and granular appearance over an area of 25 x 18mm anteriorly and 30 x 20mm posteriorly.  On sectioning the myometrium has a soft pale appearance.  The right ovary measures 25 x 20 x 16mm and has uniformly smooth outer surface.  The cut surface shows a 22mm unilocular thin wall cyst containing clear serous material. The right fallopian tube measures 40mm in length, 5mm in external diameter.  The left ovary measures 35 x 20 x 15mm and has a smooth outer surface.

649	2325	(YT/ta 29/1/62)  
649	2345	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Q Edouard): 
649	2385	A.  Sections of omentum show small deposits of carcinoma with a papilliform architecture with occasional psammoma bodies.The nuclei show mild pleomorphism with occasional intranuclear inclusions.  The appearances favour serous adenocarcinoma. 
649	2628	B.  Sections of the uterus show endometrial adenocarcinoma comprising well formed glandular elements lined by columnar cells.  Focal mucinous differentiation is present.  The nuclei focally have high grade features with clear chromatin and prominent nucleoli.  The appearance of this carcinoma is that ofendometrioid adenocarcinoma with grade 1 architecture and grade 3 nuclei giving an overall grade of 2.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Carcinoma invades to a depth of 9mm through a wall thickness of 11mm.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  Both ovaries show benign serous cystadenomas and both fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.   
649	3322	COMMENT: 
649	3331	The morphological appearance of the carcinomas within the omentum and endometriumare different and are thus favoured to be synchronous tumours of primary peritoneal serous adenocarcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.   
649	3572	This case has been reviewed by Dr Q Cauterucci. 
649	3620	DIAGNOSIS: 
649	3631	A & B.  Cervix, uterus, tubes and ovaries, omentum: 
649	3683	-  Synchronous peritoneal and endometrial tumours 
649	3733	-  Primary peritoneal serous adenocarcinoma of the omentum

649	4238	Comment: 
649	4247	Absence (loss)of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene. 
649	4514	Preserved nuclear stainingof a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

650	7056	B and D (Left periventricular frontal tumour). 
650	7103	Multiple fragments of tumour consisting of moderately pleomorphic elongated cells, predominantly arranged in interweaving bundles.  Scattered cells with nuclear pseudoinclusions are identified.  Mitoses are easily found and the Ki-67 labelling index is approximately 20-30%.  Foci of necrosis are present and there is prominent microvascular proliferation.  Compared to the right frontal tumour (see below) this lesion is more cellular and the cells more uniform and less pleomorphic. 
650	7588	Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only and highlight the microvascular proliferation.  The tumour cells are strongly Vimentin positive and many are also GFAP positive. 
650	7772	There is moderate granular membranous and some cytoplasmic MIC2 staining. CD34 stains endothelial cells.  There is a small amount of focal patchy interstitial staining, although this is much less prominent than in the contralateral lesion (see:below).  Scattered strongly p53 : positive cells are noted, probably <5%. Compared to the contralateral lesion there are also more numerous weakly staining cells. 
650	8179	The majority ofthe tumour cells are negative for EMA although very rare cells, especially at periphery of several tissue fragments contain an EMA-positive paranuclear dot.  Stains for NeuN, chromogranin, synaptophysin, pancytokeratin, IDH1 RI25H and TTFI are negative. 
650	8448	A and C (Right frontal corpus callosum tumour): 
650	8496	The intraoperativesmear contains two populations of cells.  The predominant component consists of cells with large round or lobated nuclei of slightly different sizes with a thin, well defined nuclear membrane, uniformly granular chromatin containing several chromcentres and often a prominent nucleolus.  Scattered binucleate cells are noted and a number of these nuclei also containing pseudoinclusions.  There is a minor component of relatively uniform cells with elongated round ended nuclei but no nucleoli.  Some -perivascular lymphocytes are noted but no vascular proliferation is seen. 
650	9090	The permanent sections consist of multiple pieces of tissue including fragments of normal cerebral cortex and fragments of solid tumour. 
650	9227	The tumour is moderately cellular and pleomorphic.  Many of the tumour cells have medium to large round or lobated nuclei with a prominent nucleolus and a small amount of well delineated perinuclear clear to granular cytoplasm.  A number also contain nuclear pseudoinclusions and several are bi- or trinucleate.  Scattered triangular cells with darkly staining amphophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei are also included as are cells with large, hyperchromatic somewhat "smudgy" chromatin, cells with ovoid nuclei and perinuclear halos, and some with finely vacuolated cytoplasm.  Although a number of these cells resemble dysplastic neurons, stains for neural antigens including neurofilament protein, NeuN, synaptophysin and chromogranin are negative. 
650	9987	In some areas the interstitium is finely vacuolated and slightly basophilic, suggesting mucin.  There are scattered micro-cysts and very rare calcospherites.  No Rosenthal fibres or eosinophilic granular bodies are identified with haematoxylin and eosin. No ependyma is identified. 
650	10269	Perivascular chronic inflammatory cells are noted, often surrounding veins with some adventitial fibrosis.  There is no vascular proliferation or necrosis and mitotic figures are not identified.  The Ki67 labelling index is low (visually estimated at approximately 2%). 
650	10539	Although in one fragment the tumour appears to be well demarcated from the surrounding dense paucicellular fibrillary gliosis, neurofilament antibodies highlight prominent axons bundles traversing the tumour.  These are accentuated adjacent to vessels.  In some areas beaded axons and axonalspheroids are also noted. 
650	10856	Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only.  The GFAP staining is generally pale and most of the tumour cells do not show cytoplasmic immunoreactivity adjacent to the nucleus, although scattered GFAP positive processes are noted, especially adjacent to vessels.  These processes do not radiate towards the vessels as seen in ependymal perivascular pseudorosettes. 
650	11232	In addition to normal endothelial staining there is very strong, uniform CD34 immunoreactivity between the tumour cells resulting in haloes of CD34 negative cytoplasm surrounding-tumour nuclei.  Included fragments of cerebral cortex show the expected normal endothelial staining.  Vimentin also shows prominent dark interstitial staining in many of the tumourfragments, although less intense than the CD34 staining, as well as some cytoplasmic staining.  Prominent activated microglia and scattered macrophages are noted within the tumour with CD68 antibodies. Approximately 4-5% of tumour nucleiare weakly p53 positive. 
650	11853	NeuN identifies normal neurons in cortical fragments but not tumour cells. lmmunostains for synaptophysin, IDH R125H, chromogranin, pancytokeratin and TTFI are negative.  MIC2 (CD99) is also negative although there is high background staining. 
650	12097	FISH analysis (Dr R Maltez, CLONCURRY MULTI-PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE's Hospital) on the right frontal tumour was negative for lp/19q loss although polysomy for Ip and 19q was demonstrated.  There was no EGFR amplification. 
650	12318	MGMT methylation analysis by pyrosequencing (Dr Koori Challis, QUILPIE HOSPITAL Cancer Centre) demonstrated MGMT promoter methylation in both tumours. 
650	12469	Diagnosis: 
650	12480	Left frontal tumour:  GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV) 
650	12530	Right frontal tumour:  DIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE II; see Comment) 
650	12602	Comment: 
650	12611	The right frontal lesion is a low grade glioma without high grade features and is best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).  However, a number of unusual morphological findings are noted, including the very limited GFAP staining and the strong CD34 immunoreactivity, that are not typical of most WHO grade II diffuse astrocytomas. 
650	12957	Although limited or absent GFAP staining is described in some subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, there are no other features supporting this diagnosis.  Similarly, although CD34 immunoreactivity is a feature of many glioneuronal tumours and of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, the other morphologicaland immunohistochemical findings in this case do not support these diagnoses. 
650	13337	The relationship between the left and the right frontal lesions is uncertain.  Although they are radiologically and morphologically distinct, suggesting separate lesions, the possibility of microscopic continuity or a common origin cannot be entirely excluded. FISH analysis to assess Ip and 19q polysomy and EGFR amplification will be performed on the left frontal glioblastoma.  If clinically indicated, further genetic analysis may be helpful. 
650	13784	This case was reviewed by Dr Arie Perry (Director of Neuropathology, UCSF) who agreed that the left frontal lesion is a glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).  He also agreed that the right frontal tumour is unusual but considered that the features were those of a low grade tumour, best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II). 
650	14114	commented that he had also seen low grade astrocytomas with limited GFAP immunoreactivity.  He suggested that further immunostaining for other glial markers, 
650	14272	including Olig-2, Sox-2 and S100, might-be helpful.

663	1856	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Grasso): 
663	1895	A.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  The specimen comprises fibroadipose tissue, subcutis, skeletal muscle and some fascia.  Adjacent to this short sutured margin (towards tumour) there is organising granulation tissue, fibrosis, chronic inflammation and fat necrosis consistent with previous surgery.  Within this area there are vascular changes consistent with previous radiotherapy including mural hyalinisation and intimal myxoid alteration.  Scattered within the area adjacent to the short sutured margin and within septa between skeletal muscle bundles, there are dispersed spindle and stellate cells with a generally low nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, mild nuclear atypia and some fine cytoplasmic vacuolation.  Some cells have a ganglion cell-like appearance.  These cells are favoured to represent fibroblast/myofibroblasts with mild atypia secondary to radiotherapy.  Occasional similar cells are seen withinfat lobules, however, no definite lipoblasts, significant variation in adipocyte cell size or markedly atypical stromal cells are seen.  No diagnostic evidence of residual sarcoma is seen.   
663	3022	The previous excision (89F79143) was reviewed when reporting this case.

665	359	MACROSCOPIC: 
665	372	Specimen labelled "Extended right hemicolectomy" consists of a right hemicolectomy measuring 210mm in length including section of terminal ileum 60mm in length.  No appendix is included in the specimen.  45mm from the distal resection margin there is a circumferential ulcerated tumour over a32mm area.  Over this area the serosa has areas of fat which appears adherent to the serosal surface.  The cut surface reveals that the tumour invades to a maximum depth of 15mm through the muscularis propria into the mesenteric fat and focally appears to abut the peritoneal surface over the fat.  On the mucosal surface a ?polyp is identified 45mm from the ileocaecal junction.

668	82	GIST from c/o junction.  
668	107	MACROSCOPIC: 
668	120	Specimen labelled "Stomach", consists of a pouch shaped segment of stomach with one opened end and one blind end measuring 65mm in length and up to 40mm in diameter.  The serosal surface is smooth.  The resection margin (circumference of the opened end) is inked blue after removing the staples.  There is a solid submucosal tumour 53 x 30 x 22mm.  The tumour has a pale cut surface.  The mucosal overlying the tumour appears tobe focally ulcerated.  The tumour is well defined and only loosely adherent to the overlying mucosa.  The tumour is 3mm from the resection margin (after removing the staples). 
668	724	Blocks:  1 - tumour and blue inked new margin; 2 to 6 - representative sections of the tumour (3 - reserve block); 7 - section of mucosa away from the tumour (diff quick requested).   (EG/bl 26/3/64) 
668	924	MICROSCOPIC (reportedby Dr H Brazen): 
668	962	Sections show a circumscribed tumour within submucosa and partly ulcerating the overlying mucosa.  The tumour is of low to moderate cellularity and consists of spindle shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, in haphazard fascicles.  The cells have themorphologic appearance of smooth muscle cells and this is confirmed with strong positive staining for desmin.  Stains for C-Kit (CD117) and CD34 are negative.  No mitoses are identified and the proliferation index with a K-67 stain is very low, <1%.  The appearances are of a leiomyoma.  There isno significant atypia and there is no evidence of malignancy.  Excision is complete.  The overlying mucosa shows features of a severe chronic gastritis.  No Helicobacter is identified.  The gastritis may be non-specific, related to the mass lesion, but there is associated prominentatrophy of specialised gastric glands and the possibility of an autoimmune gastritis should be considered.  There is no intestinal metaplasiaor dysplasia.

669	1597	Rectum plus donuts:  No significant abnormality.    
669	1649	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (Reported by Dr M Chudy, 2/10/2063): 
669	1707	The entire specimen is re-examined by Dr M Lievano and Dr Narelle TALAYUMPTEWA.  No macroscopic/serosal lesion is identified in the specimen A (low anterior resection).  No tumour recurrence is seen.  Two additional blocks (A13 and A14) are taken near the blue inked margin.  Sections of these blocks show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
669	2078	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: (Reported by Dr M Lauridsen 22/11/63) 
669	2138	The specimen was examined by the surgical registrar who found a soft 10mm serosal nodule.  This proved on histology to be extravasated mucus with a surrounding rim of fibrous tissue.  The origin of this extravasated mucus is uncertain, but a ruptured mucocele from some other site should be considered.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

673	83	Left renal tumour.  Left renal mass. 
673	120	MACROSCOPIC: 
673	133	Specimen labelled "Left kidney" consists of a kidney incompletely covered with perinephric fat measuring 180 x 130 x 70mm and weighing 765g. There is an attached ureter which measures 110mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm. On sectioning the kidney itself measures 110 x 65 x 60mm. There is a well circumscribed mass located in the lower pole which measures 60 x 50 x 50 mm.  The mass has a dark red cut surface with multiple cystic spaces ranging from 1 to 4mm.  The mass appears to abut but not penetrate the renal capsule.  
673	668	Blocks:  1 - ureteric margin; 2 - vascular margins; 3 & 4 - sections of tumour closest to capsule; 5 to 8 - representative tumour (5 - reserved block); 9 - renal pelvis; 10 to 12 - representative uninvolved kidney.  (TO: PC; HA/rt 16.12.63) 
673	909	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof I Bonnenfant): 
673	956	Sections show a well circumscribed 60mm tumour consistent with a renal oncocytoma. The tumour is composed of relatively monomorphic cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in nests, tubules and lining cystic spaces. Mitoses are not prominent.In some areas the rounded tumour cell nests are surrounded by loose myxoid stroma.  
673	1303	The tumour abuts but does not invade the renal capsule.  
673	1360	The ureteric and vascular resection margins are clear. 
673	1415	The surrounding renal parenchyma shows patchy mild chronic interstitial inflammation and scattered sclerosed glomeruli, particularly around the edge of the tumour, possibly reflecting local compressive changes. Elsewhere the renal parenchyma appears unremarkable. 
673	1679	The tumour is negative for Hale's colloidal iron staining. Immunoperoxidase staining is positive for CD117 and negative for CD10, CK7 and vimentin. 
673	1827	These features are consistent with a renal oncocytoma. Dr Richard Jin has also seen this case and agrees with this diagnosis.

680	1938	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Y Bethell): 
680	1978	A. Four lymph nodes identified show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. 
680	2051	B. The solitary tumour identified macroscopically shows features of a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. It is composed of nests and trabeculae of malignant hepatocytes with increased nuclear pleomorphism,prominent nucleoli, moderate amount of clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and frequent mitoses. Hepatocellular carcinoma abuts the liver capsule focally but capsular perforation is not seen. Carcinoma is 0.5mm from the closest surgical resection margin. No obvious lymphovascular invasion is identified. Special stains (Reticulin and Perl's iron) reveal markedly thickened liver cell plates and absence of iron deposition within the tumour. On immunohistochemistry, the tumour shows positive staining with Hepar-1 and AFP, and negative staining with CK7 and CK20. Polyclonal CEA shows a canalicular staining pattern while CD34 highlights the endothelial-lined trabeculae of the tumour. 
680	2956	The uninvolved liver parenchyma shows preservation of normal lobular architecture. There is a mild lymphocytic infiltrate within the portal tracts but no significant interphase or lobular inflammation is noted. There is a mild expansion of the portal tracts without septa formation. The METAVIR activity and fibrosis scores are A0 and F1 respectively. The orcein special stain and Hepatitis B surface antigen immunostain are positive, in keeping with the clinical history. No furthersignificant pathology is noted with the remaining special stains (PAS, PAS/D, Masson, reticulin, Perl's iron and rhodanine). There is no evidence of cirrhosis. 
680	3599	Sections of the gall bladder show mild wall thickening associated with mild chronic inflammation.  Mild Rokitansky Aschoff sinus formation is present.  The appearance is consistent with mild chronic cholecystitis.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

681	412	MACROSCOPIC: 
681	425	Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix" consists of a uteruswith attached cervix and bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 198g in total.  The uterus measures 110 x 65 x 45mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 15mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is completely replaced by pale friable tumour measuring 32mm in maximum thickness, invading into the outer half of the myometrium.  It is difficult to assess the thickness of myometrium but is estimated to measure up to 20mm.  The tumour appears to invade into the parametrial tissue at the left posterior aspect of the uterus.  The right fallopian tube measures 35mm in length and 3mm in maximum diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 10 x 10mmand has an unremarkable cut surface.

(PN/ta 11/3/64)  
681	1858	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Ebia):  
681	1896	Sections show of the endometrial tumour show a grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma.  Some of the tumour consists of well formed endometroid glands but there is a significant (>50%) solid component so overall it is grade 3.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrial invasion is 30mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 31mm.  There is multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium.  Tumour is confirmed to directly extend into left parametrial soft tissue and there is invasion of a medium size muscular vein in this region (block 15).  There is quite prominent multifocal tumour involvement of the surface of the endocervix and also some involvement of endocervical glands but no cervical stromal invasion is seen.  Tumour involving the surface of the endocervix is 8mm from the nearest ectocervical excision margin.  There is a small amount of uninvolved endometrium and this shows features of exogenous hormone effect. 
681	2849	Sections of the ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable.   
681	2915	DIAGNOSIS:   
681	2928	Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:  Grade 3 endometroid adenocarcinoma of endometrium showing deep myometrialinvasion and direct invasion into left parametrial soft tissue.  Tumour involvement of surface of endocervix.  Multifocal lymphovascular invasion.

683	5007	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Eisenbeisz): 
683	5050	A.  Four lymph nodes show reactive changes only.  There is no evidence of malignancy (0/4).   
683	5144	B.  Sections show a grade 3 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma which fills and expands the the uterine cavity and is wildly invasive extending into the outer half of the myometrium of the uterus in both the anterior and posteriorhalves.  The tumour shows extensive solid and trabecular architecture with a lesser component of glandular architecture.  There is also moderate squamous differentiation.  There is extensive tumour necrosis predominantly superficially and centrally within tumour nests.  Focally there is an area of sheet-like growth in which tumour cells display more pronounced nuclear pleomorphism, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli (block B17). At its deepest point of invasion, in an area where the myometrium is relatively thin, the tumour extends close to the serosal surface, 22.8mm through a myometrium 23mm thick (B25).  Elsewhere the tumour invades 41.5mm through myometrium 48.5mm in maximal thickness B10/B11). The serosa does not appear involved by tumour.  There is extensive lymphovascular invasion both within the inner and outer half of the myometrium.  No definite perineural invasion is seen.  The cervix is uninvolved by tumour.  The uterus also shows several leiomyomata including a lipoleiomyoma which is focally invaded by carcinoma.  A leiomyoma is also present in the posterior lower segment expanding the stromal compartment of the cervix.  The ectocervix and endocervix are otherwise unremarkarkable and uninvolved by tumour. The mucosa of the left fallopian tube is expanded by foamy histiocytes, however, no carcinoma is seen.  The right fallopian tube is unremarkable.  The right and left ovaries are unremarkable and uninvolved.  Within the right parametrium there are two leiomyomas.   
683	6889	C.  The cystic area in the omentum described is an area of cystic fat necrosis.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

688	1845	(OA/ta 3/1/64)  
688	1865	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Lenzen): 
688	1904	A.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is weakly proliferative.  A single leiomyoma is identified within the myometrium.  Foci of psammomatous calcification are seen on the serosal surface of the uterus, right and left fallopian tubes and ovary. The ovaries and fallopian tubes otherwise show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.  
688	2307	B.  Sections show a rounded nodule of foamy histiocytes with a central region of necrosis.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are present throughout the nodule. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
688	2515	C.  The omentum is extensively sampled revealing a single very small deposit of adenocarcinoma embedded within omental fat.  The tumour cells have pleomorphic nuclei with eosinophilic macronucleoli suggestive of serous adenocarcinoma.  Small collections of foamy histiocytes and occasional foci of psammomatous calcification are also seen.   
688	2857	COMMENT: 
688	2866	The presence of foamy histiocytes and residual psammomatous calcification are consistent with therapy effect.  The distribution of the psammomatous calcification together with the very small focus of adenocarcinoma within omentum are suggestive of a primary peritoneal serous adenocarcinoma.   
688	3162	DIAGNOSIS: 
688	3173	A - C.  Uterus and cervix, tubes and ovaries, omentum: 
688	3228	-  Very small focus of residualserous adenocarcinoma within the omentum.

689	3681	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Ruta): 
689	3718	Sections of the described cavity anterior to and abutting the sternum in the superior part of the specimen show a deposit of high grade pleomorphic sarcoma.  Thisinvolves the bone of the manubrium (block 28) and adjacent soft tissue.  It has a pushing margin and much of it is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue.  Decalcification has affected tumour preservation but it is cellular and composed of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Numerous multinucleate tumour giant cells are present.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Tumour abuts the first rib but the rib is not involved.  The second rib is also not involved by tumour.  Tumour within manubrium is 3mm from the deep excision margin but there is intact bone between tumour and the margin.  Other margins are well clear. 
689	4555	Sections of the described tan mass expanding the manubrium show dense fibrous tissue expanding and partly replacing the bone; no tumour is seen in this region.  Sections from the inferior part of the specimen show an old seroma cavity with surrounding dense fibrous tissue.  There is some old fat necrosis in the surrounding tissue, with associated mild patchy chronic inflammation.  Adjacent muscle is atrophic.  No tumour is seen in the inferior part of the specimen. 
689	5025	DIAGNOSIS: 
689	5036	Left chest wall:  Recurrent high grade pleomorphic sarcoma involving manubrium and adjacent soft tissue.

706	3545	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Lavere):  
706	3585	A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  The endometrial polyps are benign.  There is extensive tumour within fibrofat adherent to the serosa of the posterior uterus and within adhesions between the loops of rectosigmoid colonand the posterior uterus.  Tumour extends from the serosal surface of the uterus some distance into the underlying outer myometrium.  The tumour has features most consistent with a moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  Some psammoma bodies are noted.  There is some evidence of treatment effect with replacement of tumour by dense fibrous tissue; there is between 10 and 50% tumour replacement by fibrous tissue.

There is extensive tumour withinadherent fibrous tissue on the surface of both ovaries but there is minimal tumour involvement of the deeper ovarian tissue.  Portions of both fallopian tubes are also identified in sections from both adnexa.  There is extensive tumour within soft tissue adherent to the outer surfaces of both fallopian tubes.  One section from the fimbrial end of the right tube appears to show a focus of carcinoma in situ of residual tubal epithelium (block A20); the sections of residual fallopian tube are otherwise unremarkable. 
706	4937	Sections from the indurated segments of the rectosigmoid colon show extensive tumour withinfibrofat adherent to the bowel serosa, and extending some distance into the underlying outer muscularis propria.  No tumour involvement of the bowel mucosa or submucosa is seen.  A total of nine lymph nodes were identified in the attached mesenteric fat and these are all free of tumour.  There is focal tumour involvement of the bowel serosa at the proximal excision margin.

706	5665	DIAGNOSIS: 
706	5676	A.  Uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectosigmoid colon: 
706	5737	-  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving serosa and outer myometrium of uterus, serosa and outer muscularis propria of rectosigmoid colon, soft tissue adhesions between loops of rectosigmoid colon and posterior uterus, right and left parametrial soft tissues and serosa of ovaries and fallopian tubes.  Focal carcinoma in situ at fimbrial end of left tube.   
706	6111	B.  Proximal and distal bowel donuts: 
706	6149	-  No tumour.   
706	6165	C.  Omentum:   
706	6180	-  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.   
706	6225	COMMENT: 
706	6234	The distribution of the disease is most consistent with a primary peritoneal serous carcinoma, however the focal apparent carcinoma in situ at the fimbrial end of the right tube raises the possibility of tubal origin.

708	3223	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr X Millikan - 27.4.2063) 
708	3276	A.  The left ovarian tumour is a serous adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows extensive involvement of the ovarian, as well as, fallopian tube parenchyma. There are areas of serosal involvement and foci of lymphovascular space invasion. Approximately 5% of the primary tumour shows high grade cytologic atypia. There is minimal chemotherapy related change (less than 5%). There is focal uterine serosal involvement by metastatic adenocarcinoma (anterior and posterior uterus). The uterine ectocervix and endocervix show patchy mild to moderate active inflammation and tubal metaplasia. There is no convincing cervical involvement by adenocarcinoma. The endometrium appears inactive/weakly proliferative with focal polypoid cystic atrophy. The myometrium shows a hyalinised leiomyoma. The right ovary and fallopian tube show scattered detached foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma.

711	2960	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr W Broas)  
711	2999	A.  Sections of the ovary show a poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  This consists of sheets and trabeculae of cells forming papillae and slit-like glands.  There is some patchy tumour necrosis.  Lymphovascular invasion is noted in adjacent parovarian soft tissue.  Sections of the fallopian tube show extensive involvement of the mucosa, wall and serosa by serous carcinoma.  Much of the tumour in the tube wall is present within small lymphatic and/or blood vessels.  There is also extensive tumour involvement of the fimbrial end of the tube.  No definite carcinoma in situ of the residual tubal epithelium is identified.  The tumour in the fallopian tube could be metastatic from the ovary or could be part of a field effect in the Mullerian epithelium.  
711	3763	B.  A section of the posterior cervix shows extensive involvement by serous carcinoma; this involvement extends from the serosal/adventitial aspect and there is extensive lymphovascular invasion.  Thelining mucosa of the cervix is not involved.  The serous carcinoma extends to the inferior excision margin of the posterior cervix.  A section of the anterior cervix also shows patchy tumour involvement just beneath the serosal/adventitial surface.   
711	4214	Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.  The described endometrial polyp is benign.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion by serous carcinoma in the outer myometrium and there is extensive involvement of the outer fundal myometrium by serous carcinoma.  Sections from the right posterior cornual region show extensive myometrial involvement by serous carcinoma, with prominent lymphovascular invasion.  There is also a focal, minor component of clear cell carcinoma in the myometrial tumour (blockB17).  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.   
711	4795	Sections of the left ovary show extensive lymphovascular invasion by serous carcinoma.

721	848	B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, right tube + ovary + left tube" consists of auterus with attached cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries weighing in total 68g.  The uterus measures 80 x 40 x 40mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 20mm and has anunremarkable surface.  On sectioning, in the fundus there is a fungating and exophytic tumour measuring 20 x 20mm with a maximum thickness of 7mm out of a total myometrial thickness of 20mm.  Elsewhere the endometrium is 1mm thick.  There is a fibroid, 5mm diameter, in the myometrium.   measuring 5mm.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 50 x 5 x 5mm.  The right ovary has a cystic appearance and measures 35 x 20 x 20mm.  On sectioning the cyst is filled with serous fluid.  The internal surface of the cyst is smooth.  The left fallopian tube has a looped appearance and measures 35mm long.  The tube appears congested and dilated in the middle part, up to 15mm in maximum diameter.   
721	1870	Blocks: 1 to 4 - full representative section of anterior body and cervix; 5 & 6 - two representative sections of anterior endomyometrium; 7 - myometriumwith fibroid; 8 to 10 - one full LS of posterior body and cervix; 11 to 13 - three representative sections of the posterior and the myometrium with tumour; 14 - two LS right fimbria with cyst; 15 - one representative section of the right ovary with cyst and one TS of right fallopian tube with cyst; 16 - two LS of left fimbria; 17 & 18 - left fallopian tube multiple TS; 19 - right parametrial tissue; 20 - left parametrial tissue; re-select 21 to 25 - left cornu.

Six representative sections in 6 blocks.   
721	2802	D.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a fragment of omentum 20 x 20 x 10mm with a small fibrous area 5mm in maximum diameter.  AE 2 blocks. 
721	2955	(MR/ta 9/7/63)  
721	2973	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Proby): 
721	3011	A.  Sections show fibrofat with a deposit of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.   
721	3095	B.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrial tumour show an endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  It is architectural grade 1 but has severe cytologic atypia, with large vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, so is overall grade 2.  No definite myometrial invasion is seen.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. There is no cervical involvement.  There are foci of adenomyosis in the myometrium and a leiomyoma is also confirmed in the myometrium. 
721	3564	Sections of the left fallopian tube show that this is distended by a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with a papillary architecture.  This involves the mucosa and projects into the tube lumen.  Most of the lining epithelium of the tube is unremarkable, apart from being attenuated by the tube dilation.  The tubal tumour shows mucinous differentiation.  Sections of the left cornu show no connection between the endometrial tumour and the left tubal tumour. 
721	4025	At the fimbrial end of the tube there is focal involvement of the surface epithelium by endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Sectionsfrom the right and left parametrial soft tissue show occasional small subserosal deposits of metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma. 
721	4284	Sections of the right fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the right ovary show a simplecyst. The ovary is otherwise unremarkable. 
721	4424	C.  Sections show ovary with extensive involvement by a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  This shows extensive mucinous differentiation.  A fibroma is also noted.  With immunostains the tumour cells are strongly oestrogen receptor and cytokeratin 7 positive, and also show patchy progesterone receptor positivity, but they are cytokeratin 20 negative.  The appearance and immunophenotype are most consistent with a primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma showing mucionous differentiation, rather than a metastatic mucinous carcinoma.    
721	4962	D.  Sections show unremarkable fat.  No tumour is seen.  (ec)   
721	5026	Comment:  It is most likely thatthe endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the endometrium and left ovary are separate primaries.  The left tubal tumour seems likely to be a metastasis from the left ovary but could also possibly be a further primary.  Sections of the left cornu show no connection between the endometrial tumour and the left tubal tumour. 
721	5375	The slides have also been viewed by Dr I Vivyan.

756	2805	Sections of the appendix show replacement of the mucosa by a mucinous neoplasm with low to moderate dysplasia.  In most areas, the mucosal epithelium is underlined by a chronic inflammatory infiltrate, and in the sections examined, there is no apparent perforation. There are no areas of high grade changes within the mucosa.  There is extensive infiltration of the appendiceal wall together with extensive involvement of other abdominal organs by pseudomyxoma peritonei.  There are numerous mucin lakes, some of which are rimmed bysimilar appearing atypical mucinous epithelium of low to intermediate grade.  However, in other areas, there are aggregates of poorly differentiated signet ring cells with appearances in keeping withmucinous adenocarcinoma.  This pseudomyxoma process involves the serosal aspect of portions of both the small and the large bowel with encasing of portions of both organs by tumour.  There is also surface involvement of the spleen and gallbladder, together with extensive involvement of the omentum and peritoneum. 
756	3851	Representative sections of the gallbladder mucosa are unremarkable andsections of the stomach are also unremarkable.  There is no evidence of inflammation and Helicobacter are not seen.  Sections of splenic parenchyma are within normal limits.

780	4054	Comment: 
780	4063	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germlinemutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene. 
780	4330	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

780	4586	AMMENDED REPORT: (A/Prof J Magos 21/4/64) 
780	4628	Following presentation at the Colorectal Meeting by Dr J Warntz, the recent past history of a rectal carcinoid tumour was realised. In view of this, neuroendocrine markers were performed on the solitary lymph node metastasis and these were found to be positive, consistent with metastaticcarcinoid tumour (low grade neuroendocrine tumour) rather than rectal adenocarcinoma.  
780	5003	The staging of the current rectal adenocarcinoma is therefore classified as pN0.  
780	5086	Dr J Panak has discussed this amendment to the staging with the clinical team.

The spleen is 145 x 95 x50mm, weighs 222g, and contains no focal abnormality.  There is attached unremarkable greater omentum, 285 x 200 x 15mm.  The anterior surface of the pancreas is covered by smooth peritoneum.  The proximal portion of the pancreas contains a solid tumour, 85 x 65 x 45mm.  The tumour has a fleshy tan appearance.  The border of the tumour is smooth and pushing with no infiltrative areas seen.  The tumour appears to have been excised intact, however abuts the anterior/peritoneal surface, superior and inferior margins and stapled margin adjacent to pancreatic neck.  The posterior margin overlying the tumour has a grooved area (inked blue) and a flat area located distalto the groove (inked black).  There are three stapled margins adjacent to the groove (inked green).  The tumour is 1mm clear of the inked black margin and 2mm clear of the inked blue margin.  The pancreas distal to the tumour has a lobulated yellow appearance.  A 25mm lymph node lies adjacent to the pancreatic neck. 
783	1543	Blocks:  1 & 2 - pancreatic tumour with stapled margin closest to pancreatic neck; 3 & 4 - tumour with grooved posterior margin; 5 - inferior aspect of tumour; 6 - superior aspect of tumour; 7 to 9 - tumour with flat part of posterior margin; 10 - central portion of tumour (reserved block); 11 - tumour with adjacent splenic artery; 12 - tumour with adjacent pancreas; 13 - uninvolved tail of pancreas; 14 - splenic hilum; 15 - splenic capsule; 16 to18 - greater omentum; 19 & 20 - TS one lymph node at pancreatic neck; 21 - one splenic hilar lymph node; 22 & 23 multiple splenic hilar lymph nodes.

783	2316	MICROSCOPIC (Reported byDr V Sagastume & registrar Dr V Calvert): 
783	2382	A.  Sections of the pancreas show a focallyencapsulated tumour with a multinodular growth pattern; with a maximum macroscopic dimension of 85mm.  The tumour cells are predominantly arranged in trabeculaeand acini separated by hyalinised stroma.  The tumour cells have granular cytoplasm and mainly uniform nuclei with a clumped nuclear chromatin pattern.  Moderate numbers of mitoses are seen, up to 18 mitoses per 50 high power fields (block 4).  There is no necrosis within the tumour.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is seen with tumour covered by endothelial cells.  No perineural invasion is seen. 
783	2984	The tumour shows diffuse positive staining with synaptophysin and CD56, while patchy positive staining is seen with chromogranin.  Insulin, gastrin, glucagon and somatostatin stains are essentially negative.  Positive staining is seen with PR and alpha1-antitrypsin.  The tumour is negative for CD10 and tumour nuclei are negative for beta-catenin.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is up to 5%. 
783	3377	The morphological, immunohistochemical and Ki-67 proliferation index of this tumour are consistent with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET), grade 2 (WHO classification, 2010).  
783	3560	The tumour has a mainly pushing border, and comes to less than 0.1mm of the superior margin, 0.2mm of the posterior margin, 1mm ofthe pancreatic margin and 1.5mm of the inferior margin.

785	411	MACROSCOPIC: 
785	424	Specimen labelled "Whipple's with portal vein" consists of a Whipple's resection with a bowel measuring 270mmin length including area of distal stomach 25mm in length.  The pancreatic head measures 65 x 55 x 50mm.  Upon opening, the proximal duodenum appears dilated with the mucosa flattened.  There is a roughened area near the ampulla projecting into the lumen which is possibly ulcerated, measuring 15 x 10mm.  The duodenal mucosa appears haemorrhagic distally but otherwise unremarkable.  The anterior pancreatic margin is inked blue.  The uncinate is inked black.  The posterior is inkedgreen with the portal vein area inked red.  The superior aspect is also inked black.  The pancreatic neck resection margin is shaved and the underlying area is inked yellow.  The cut surface reveals a friable tumour which appears to be centred in the duodenum in close proximity to the papilla.  The tumour extends into the lumen and appears to partially obstruct it.  The surrounding pancreatic tissue appears fibrotic and it is difficult to assess the extent of involvementof the tumour into the pancreas.  The cystic duct appears dilated throughout its length and was unable to be probed into the duodenum, and appears therefore obstructed.  Multiple lymph nodes were identified in the pericystic duct and along the gastric resection margin.  The attached gallbladder measures 100mm in length with a maximum external diameter of 45mm.Maximum thickness of the wall is 7mm.  The wall appears oedematous in places.  The mucosa has prominent yellow streaks around.  The lumen is full of large amounts of green biliary sludge but no gallstones are identified.  The cut surface reveals that the tumour appears clear of the portal vein.  Two separate fragments of fatty tissue ?omentum were identified measuring 130 and 150mm in maximum dimension.  A few small cream nodules are identified in the omental fat ?fat necrosis.  No other suspicious areas are identified.

(TE/ta 25/3/64)   
794	1742	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Mountain):  
794	1784	Sections from the cardia, body, antrum, greater curve and lesser curve show extensive involvement of the stomach wall by a poorly differential adenocarcinoma of diffuse type.  The tumour consists of small groups, cords and single cells which are present extensively throughout the mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer and subserosa.  The cells have large, moderately pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Numerous signet ring cells are noted.  Tumour extends to the serosal surface of the stomach and also extensively infiltrates fat attached to the lesser curve and omental fat attached to the greater curve.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is noted in the submucosa of the body.  Foci of perineural invasion are also identified in the stomach wall.  
794	2566	There is metastatic tumour in six out of eight lymph nodes which were found in fat attached to the lesser curve, and in one out of fournodes which were found in omental fat attached to the greater curve.   
794	2772	Sections from the proximal margin show a short length of squamous lined oesophageal wall.  There is adenocarcinoma involving the full thickness of the wall of the distal oesophagus and undermining overlying normal surface squamous epithelium, but the proximal margin appears free of tumour.  Tumour is 3mm from the proximal margin at the closest point.   
794	3127	Sections of the distal margin show small intestinal wall including Brunner's glands.  No tumour is seen in the small intestinal wall and the distal margin is well clear of tumour.   
794	3309	Remaining uninvolved gastric mucosa shows changes of a chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia.  Stains for Helicobacter pylori will be performed and a supplementary report issued.

795	752	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Gaal): 
795	789	Sections of the described area of serosal puckering show a deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  In the sections this measures 9mm in main diameter.  It consists of crowded glands lined by cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The tumour extends to just beneath the serosal surface of the liver and there is a heavy associated mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cell reaction.  The features are consistent with metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is identified.  Sections of the other described poorly defined pale area show a second deposit of similar metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  In the sections this measures 8mm in main diameter.There is associated dense fibrosis and a heavy mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cell reaction.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is identified.  deposits are well away from the hepatic resection margin.

796	1559	(TO: VD;KN/vo 23.3.64)  
796	1583	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Momplaisir): 
796	1626	A.  Sections show tumour tissue.  No normal brain is seen.  The tumour is cellular and consists mainly of spindle cells with elongated nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, in haphazard short fascicles.  There are also foci where the tumour cells have more plump atypical nuclei and better fined cytoplasm.  Mitoses are present, including atypical forms.  The features are consistent with a gliosarcoma with predominant sarcomatous component.     
796	2070	B.Sections show pieces of tumour tissue.  The larger piece has overlying dura.  No normal brain tissue is seen.  The tumour is similar to specimen A.  It consists mainly of spindle cells in short, haphazard fascicles.  Mitoses are frequent,numbering up to 22 per 10 HPF, and some atypical mitoses are noted.  Some tumour cells have a single, prominent nucleolus.  The cells are predominantly spindle shaped but there are patchy areas of more plump, pleomorphic, atypical cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and better defined cell borders.  Some binucleate and multinucleate tumour cells are also noted.  There are patchy foci of tumour necrosis.  Tumour abuts and focally invades into and through the overlying dura (block B4).   
796	2799	Reticulin stains show that most of the tumour is reticulin rich but a minor component has more scant reticulin.  The features are most consistent with a gliosarcoma.  The sarcomatous component is the predominant spindle cell tumour which is reticulin rich, while the high grade glioma (astrocytic) component has the more plump, pleomorphic cells and scant reticulin.  The high grade glioma component also shows more prominent and extensive GFAP positivity.  There is a merging of the glial and sarcomatous components.  A p53 immunostain is negative.  A Ki-67 stain shows a high proliferation index, estimated at around 80%.   
796	3425	The histology of the previous tumour (20S65987 B&C) has been reviewed.  Further stains are pending on that specimen and a supplementary report will follow.   
796	3583	IDH1 immunostaining and MGMT promoter methylation testing was done on the previous tumour and has not been repeated.   
796	3702	C.  Sections show a piece of greymatter and white matter with some reactive astrocytosis, and also some tumour tissue.  The tissue appears to include a pial surface and subpial accumulation of tumour cells is noted.   
796	3920	D.  Sections show a piece of tumour tissue.  The tumour is cellular and predominantly composed of spindle cells.   
796	4035	DIAGNOSIS:  
796	4047	A.  Right temporal:  Gliosarcoma. 
796	4081	B.  Right temporal:  Gliosarcoma (WHO grade 4) with predominant sarcomatous component. 
796	4168	C.  Deep temporal tissue:  Involvement by gliosarcoma.   
796	4225	D.  Arachnoid thickening:  Involvement by gliosarcoma.   
796	4282	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (14.4.64): 
796	4314	The histology of the previous right parietal tumour (20S65987) has been reviewed and further reticulin and GFAP stains have been performed.  The previous tumour lacks the spindle cell appearance of the present tumour and reticulin is only around blood vessels, not individual cells.  Also, it is generally GFAP positive.  The previous tumour is still considered to be a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4); no sarcomatous component is identified.

Slice one 12 o'clock margin, slice fifteen 6 o'clock margin.  In slices five to nine there is a solid poorly defined white tan lesion measuring 40mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 40mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 30mm in maximum thickness.  Macroscopically all the margins appear clear of tumour.  Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram.

801	2087	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Junor): 
801	2125	A. Twelve lymph nodes identified show no evidence of metastatic tumour. 
801	2197	B. Sections show skin with prominent solar elastosis excised to the level of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a 40mm malignant dermocutaneous tumour with similar morphology as that seen in the previous excision from SOUTH SURGICAL ASSESSMENT UNIT Pathology (labelled 25-PYGJ 25692 Herbig, H 256923864; see also review report by Dr H Delauder 25P92386). The tumour is composed of sheets and short fascicles of pleomorphic spindled and epithelioid cells as well as malignant multinucleated cells with bizarre, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures are prominent. The appearanceis that of a malignant dermocutaneous tumour with features consistent with a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma shows invasion into underlying skeletal muscle but no connection to the epidermis isseen. No obvious lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified. 
801	3047	Excision appears complete and the excision margins are as follow: 
801	3113	 12 o'clock >10mm 
801	3131	 3 o'clock 8mm 
801	3146	 6 o'clock >10mm 
801	3163	 9 o'clock >10mm 
801	3180	 Deep >10mm 
801	3193	The overlying skin showsa scar in keeping with previous excision. The epidermis appears attenuated in areas with increased numbers of basal melanocytes displaying mild cytologic atypia. However, lentiginous proliferation of these melanocytes is not seen. Subepithelial collections of lymphocytes are focally present but no definite features of a regressed melanocytic lesion are identified.

803	2431	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr K Hatman) 
803	2471	A.  Sections are of skin extending to deep subcutaneous tissue, including skeletal muscle and fascia towards the deep aspect. Residual/recurrent well differentiated liposarcoma is present withinsubcutaneous tissue and extends from the medial side of the specimen along its posteroinferior aspect, inferior to the attached deep fascia. The well differentiated liposarcoma consists of scattered moderately to highly pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei within adipose and fibrous tissue (mixed lipogenic and sclerosing type). The surrounding dermocutaneous and fascial tissue shows extensive changes consistent with previous surgery. No evidence of de-differentiation in the extensive sections examined. The margins of excision are as follows: 
803	3210	Deep margin: Present at margin (block 31 and 45). 
803	3260	Inferior margin: Present at margin (blocks 9 and 18).

803	3444	B.  Sections of the left retroperitoneal tissue include adipose and fibrous tissue showing features consistent with well differentiated liposarcoma (mixed lipogenic,sclerosing and inflammatory type). The well differentiated liposarcoma consists predominantly of adipocytes showing mild variation in size with occasional atypical enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei. Scattered fibrous septae containing atypical hyperchromatic nuclei, as well as, patchy chronic inflammatory changes are also present. The liposarcoma extends focally to the surgical margin. Within the surrounding mature adipose tissue there is an entrapped tubular structure, lined by (focally ciliated) pseudostratified epithelium with surrounding basal cells and laminated smooth muscle, favoured to represent a portion of the ductus deferens. Patchy changes consistent with previous surgery are present. There isno evidence of de-differentiation in the sections examined.

806	1019	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Nannen) 
806	1059	The gastric tumour is a 32mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST is predominantly circumscribed with a lobulated, pushing margin and expands the muscularis propria. The tumour is moderately cellular and is composed of bland spindled cells arranged in broad interweaving fascicles. In areas, the tumour cells appear moderately pleomorphic with variably sized nucleoli. There is widespread conspicuous paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuolisation. Centrally, the tumour shows prominent stromal oedema and hyalinosis. Mitoses are present up to 3 per 50 high power fields. Necrosis is inconspicuous. The tumour is largely surrounded by muscularis propria, but focally extends close to, but does not appear to involve, theserosal surface. The tumour is clear of the gastric resection margins (0.56mm). The overlying gastric mucosa shows no significant histologic abnormality.  
806	1937	Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows: 
806	2011	Tumour cells positive for: CD117, CD34. 
806	2051	Tumour cells negative for: SMA, Desmin, S100, CAM5.2. 
806	2105	The Ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights approximately 7% of tumour cell nuclei.  
806	2194	COMMENT: 
806	2203	The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours less than 50mm in size and with a low mitotic rate (less than 5/50hpf), are typically associated with a low risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM).  
806	2565	Please correlate with clinical, radiologic and intra-operative findings. 
806	2640	SUMMARY: 
806	2649	Gastric tumour: 32mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour, close to gastric resection margin (0.56mm) (please see comment).

Please see diagram.  Blocks 1 to 12 - left rectus muscle; 13 & 14 - right rectus.   
807	2085	B.  Specimen labelled "Right lateral margin" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue, unoriented, 26 x 15 x 10mm.  The margin is inked blue.  The specimen is serially sliced.  The cut surface is predominantly yellow andglistening.  There are intervening pale streaks within the fatty tissue.  No tumour is seen.  AE 2 blocks.  (EO/mm 14.6.62)  
807	2430	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr X Petretti):    
807	2474	A. The sections show a desmoid tumour invading skeletal muscle and fibrofatty tissue.  Immunoperoxidase stains show expression of betacatenin antigen in the tumour cells.  It reaches the deep margin in scattered foci (e.g., blocks A5, A6), focally reaches the superficial margin (block A9), superior margin (blockA7) and inferior margin (A11). It is more than 5mm from the other margins.  Patchy chronic inflammation and many groups of macrophages (CD68 positive, Cam 5.2 negative) are seen.   
807	2968	B. The sections show fibrofatty tissue and skeletal muscle.  There is no evidence of malignancy (confirmed with beta catenin immunoperoxidase stains).

810	447	Patient details checked by  YQ/lj 
810	481	A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 60g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 25mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 28mm and has an unremarkable surface.  Anteriorly there is an endometrial polyp 30 x 20 x12mm.  The myometrium is focally thickened up to 19mm and contains three fibroids ranging from 10 to 17mm in maximum dimension.  All fibroids have whorled grey cut surfaces.  The right ovary measures 35 x 8 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The right fallopian tube is 45mm in length and up to 12mm in diameter, and is unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 50  x 10 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.The left fallopian tube is 50mm in length and up to 10mm in diameter and is unremarkable.    
810	1324	Blocks: 1 to 3 - full LS of anterior body and cervix (block 3 contains base of the endometrial polyp); 4 to 6 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 7 - section of anterior endomyometrium including part of polyp; 8 to 10 - the remainder of the endometrial polyp; 11 & 12 - all of the right ovary; 13 - representatives right fallopian tube including all of the fimbrial end; 14 to 16 - all of the left ovary; 17 - representative TS left fallopian tube; 18 - all of the fimbrial end of the left fallopian tube; 19 & 20 -remainder of the left fallopian tube; 21 - remainder of the right fallopian tube.  The fallopian tubes are blocked in total.  (RP/mm 15.11.62)  
810	1987	B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omental fatty tissue 200 x 70 x 28mm.There is an indurated nodule with a pale/yellow cut surface 35 x 30 x 12mm.   
810	2157	Blocks: 1 to 3 - representative sections of the nodule; 3 - reserve block for tumour bank.  (RA/ta 13/11/62)  
810	2273	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Kranawetter):  
810	2318	A.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that the described polyp is benign.  The endometrium elsewhere is thin and inactive.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  Focally on the serosa of the anteriorand posterior uterus there are psammoma bodies with associated fibrous tissue and very occasional degenerate tumour cells.  The features are consistent with focal serosal involvement by treated tumour.  Sections of the left fallopian tube show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma quite extensively involving the tube wall and serosa, and also extending to involve part of the mucosa.  No carcinoma in situ is identified in the residual tubal lining epithelium or at the fimbrial end.     
810	3099	Sections of the right fallopian tube show scattered foci of serous carcinoma in the tube wall and at the fimbrial end.    
810	3221	Sections of both ovaries show very occasional small serosal and sub-serosal tumour deposits but the ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.   
810	3359	B.  Sections show omentum with one large deposit and multiple other deposits of serous carcinoma.  This is moderately differentiated.  There is some evidence of chemotherapy effect with some replacement of tumour by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue.  This is assessed as less than 50% tumour replacement by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue.  
810	3709	Comment:  The involvement of the wall of the left fallopian tube is quite extensive and there is some mucosal involvement but the pattern of tumour suggests spread inwards from the serosa, rather than tubal origin.  The tumour is most likely primary peritoneal. 
810	3971	Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr O Haarstad.   
810	4035	DIAGNOSIS:   
810	4048	A.  Uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes:   
810	4091	1.  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma involving both fallopian tubes and focally involving serosa of uterus and both ovaries.

814	2865	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr Z Gaulden) 
814	2905	A.  Sections of the endometrial tumour show a serous carcinoma.  Much of the tumour is moderately differentiated, comprising slit-like glands and some papillae lined by epithelial cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm.  However there is a significant proportion which consists of solid sheets and trabeculae of tumour cells so overall it is poorly differentiated.  The tumour involves the body and fundus of the uterus anteriorly and posteriorly.  There is deep myometrial invasion.  Maximum depth of myometrialinvasion measures 9.5mm where total myometrial thickness is 14mm.  There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium, some of which is well away from the main invasive tumour.  There is no cervical involvement.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Two small leiomyomas, and adenomyosis, are noted in the myometrium.  Sections of the ovaries showseveral small simple cysts bilaterally.  The ovaries are otherwise unremarkable.

816	913	Sections show a markedly enlarged lymph node.  The normal architecture is effaced and there is also extension of lymphoid tissue into surrounding fibrofat.  Around half the node has a follicular architecture.  The follicles are abnormal, being relatively uniform in size and closely packed.  They consistof mixed centroblasts and centrocytes and there is an adjusted centroblast count of greater than 15 per high power field in the follicles.  This component has features of a follicular lymphoma, grade 3A.  The remainder of the node has a diffuse architecture.  This comprises sheets of mainly large lymphoid cells with irregular nuclei and generally scanty eosinophilic cytoplasm.Some cells have eosinophilic cytoplasmic globules, consistent with immunoglobulin (Russel bodies).  This component has features of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma.  Focally in the node there is a circumscribed necrotic area with some surrounding histocytes and fibrous tissue.

819	474	Patient details checked by QS 
819	504	A.  Specimen labelled " Liver and gallblader" consists of a segment of liver with attached gallbladder.  The liver measures 120mm (medial-lateral) x 120mm (superior-inferior)x 70mm (anterior-posterior).  Multiple cysts are identified on the surface of the liver.  On section, there is a firm white and very gritty tumour 60 x 40 x 35mm.  Macroscopically it appears to infiltrate large ?vessels ?ducts.  There also appear to be several dilated ?vessels ?ducts distal to the tumour, some dilated up to 10mm in diameter.  The common bile duct is identified and measures 45mm inlength and up to 10mm in maximum diameter.  The gallbladder is attached and measures 90 x 20 x 20mm.  The cystic duct measures 60 x 5 x 5mm.  Two lymph nodes are identified in the hilum measuring 15 and 10mm in length.  
819	1298	Blocks:  1- surgical margin from a ?vessel; 2 - surgical margin common bile duct; 3 - representative section of common bile duct 20mm from the surgical margin; 4 - representative section from the bile duct 30mm from the surgical margin; 5 & 6 - longitudinal sections of common bile duct surrounded by tumour; 7 - tumour abutting the hepatic surgical margin; 8 to 12 - representative sections from tumour; 13 & 14 - representative sections from liver with dilated ?vessels; 15 - representative sections from liver away from tumour with small white nodules; 16 - representative section from the origin of the cystic duct; 17 - gallbladder neck and body; 18 - gallbladder fundus; 19 - cystic duct lymph node; 20 & 21 - one hilar lymph node each; 22 to 24 - three lymph nodes from hilum; 25 - tumour selected for tissue bank. 
819	2120	B.  Specimen labelled "Lymph node lesser sac" consists of three lymph nodes 15, 20 and 5mm.  
819	2213	Blocks:  1 to 3 - one bisected lymph node each block.   (KU/cc 19/11/62)  
819	2289	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Bailey):  
819	2329	A. The sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  The tumour surrounds the large bile ducts near the hilum.  Although most of the bile ductepithelium has been sloughed, atypical cells arising from the epithelium and forming papillary structures protruding into the duct can be seen (slide A5).  The tumour invades into adjacent liver and soft tissues and involves the caudate, left and right lobes.  Several small tumour nodules, many involving the portal tracts, are found distant from the main lesion (e.g., slide A 15 in the left lobe).  Malignant cells focally reach the capsular surface of the liver.  There is patchy chronic inflammation but no cirrhosis in the liver.  Several irregularly dilated bile ducts are seen and atypical epithelial cells are present in occasional dilated bile ducts.   
819	3182	tumour has a heterogenous appearance.  In many areas, there are glandular structures with abundant fibrotic stroma.  Variable amounts of mucin formation are seen, highlighted by the PAS stain.  Inother areas, there are micropapillary structures or cribriform glands with central necrosis.  There is a variable degree of pleomorphism in the tumour cells.  The cytoplasm varies from clear to pale eosinophilic and is moderately abundant. The tumour cells strongly express keratin 19 antigen by the immunoperoxidase technique.  Keratin 7 antigen is also expressed but in a patchy distribution.  There is no convincing expression of Hep-Par 1 antigen. Membranous expression ofbeta catenin is present but not nuclear expression of this antigen.  The tumour extends to the soft tissue resection margin over a 5mm front (block A5) and focally it is 0.3mm from the liver resection margin (block A6).  Tumour is foundwithin thin walled lymphovascular channels in the portal tracts but no tumour is found within major branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein.  Prominent perineural invasion ispresent. 
819	4280	The liver tissue abutting the tumour shows necrosis, reactive biliary proliferation and cholestasis. 
819	4381	No malignancy or dysplasia is seen in the vascular margin (slide A1) and common bile duct margin (slide A2). No definite malignancy or dysplasia is seen in the cysticduct margin (slide A16) but some of the tissue is distorted by diathermy artefact and difficult to evaluate.  
819	4657	Metastatic adenocarcinoma is seen in four of five hilar lymph nodes with extranodal spread present.  There is direct invasion of another hilar node (slide A10). 
819	4818	The gallbladder is slightly dilated and thin walled but shows no malignancy or dysplasia.  However, most of the mucosa shows autolytic changes.  No malignancy is seen in the cystic duct lymph node (slide A19).

821	272	A.  Specimen labelled "Right neck dissection, short stitch level 5, medium stitch level 3, long stitch level 2" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue with three sutures for orientation, short suture marking level 5 mid suture, medial suture marking level 3 anda long stitch marking level 2.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring from 1 to 5mm across. 
821	632	Blocks: 1 & 2 - level 2 lymph nodes; 3 & 4 - level 3 lymph nodes; 5 - level 5 lymph node; 6 - level 5 fatty tissue looking for more lymph nodes.    
821	780	B.  Specimen labelled "Lesion neck, mass suture medial margin, 12 o'clock" consists of a ellipse of skin with one suture for orientation marking the medial margin (12 o'clock) and measures 130mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 80mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 50mm in thickness.  On the surface of the skin there is a nodular area with retracted centre measuring 60 x 30mm.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  The deep margin appears to be covered by skeletal muscle.  The 3 o'clock margin isinked blue, the 9 o'clock margin black, deep margin green.  Specimen is serially sectioned from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock into fifteen slices.  Slice one 12 o'clock margin, slice fifteen 6 o'clock margin.  In slices five to nine there is a solid poorly defined white tan lesion measuring 40mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 40mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 30mm in maximum thickness.  Macroscopically all the margins appear clear of tumour.  Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram.

821	1932	A. Twelve lymph nodes identified show no evidence of metastatic tumour. 
821	2004	B. Sections show skin with prominent solar elastosis excised to the level of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a 40mm malignant dermocutaneous tumour with similar morphology as that seen in the previous excision from MACQUARIEWARD Pathology (labelled 90-BTNC 91552 Suga, Y 900750915;see also review report by Dr Y Halonen 90B75091). The tumour is composed of sheets and short fascicles of pleomorphic spindled and epithelioid cells as well as malignant multinucleated cells with bizarre, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitoticfigures are prominent. The appearance is that of a malignant dermocutaneous tumour with features consistent with a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma shows invasion into underlying skeletal muscle but no connection to the epidermis is seen. No obvious lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified. 
821	2834	Excision appears complete and the excision margins are as follow: 
821	2900	 12 o'clock >10mm

821	2967	 Deep >10mm 
821	2980	The overlying skin shows a scar in keeping with previous excision. The epidermis appears attenuated in areas with increased numbers of basal melanocytes displaying mild cytologic atypia. However, lentiginous proliferation of these melanocytes is not seen. Subepithelial collections of lymphocytes are focally present but no definite features of a regressed melanocytic lesion are identified.

821	3722	SPECIMEN 
821	3731	Received from the HILLSTON DISTRICT HOSPITAL Hospital KIAMA DOWNS, 1 block labelled "90B75091_B4". 
821	3830	PATHOLOGY 
821	3840	Histological Typing: Spindle cell malignancy 
821	3885	The sample was reviewed by a pathologist and was considered to have 50% tumour cells within thearea selected for analysis. 
821	4008	TEST DESCRIPTION 
821	4025	The sample wasanalysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]).Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation. This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater. 
821	4469	RESULT NO MUTATION DETECTED 
821	4498	INTERPRETATION 
821	4513	No BRAF mutation was detected at or surrounding codon 600 indicating that this patient will not respond to the current V600E specific BRAF inhibitors. 
821	4664	Comments 
821	4673	BRAF mutations are found in 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases(90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1-2]. V600E specific BRAF inhibitors e.g. vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been developed to inhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients. Trials of these inhibitors have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3,4,5]. The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [6].

Sections of the omentum attached to the spleen show an  omental deposit of metastatic, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous features.  Two small omental lymph nodes show no involvement.   
826	6009	Sections of the anterior peritoneal nodule confirm multiple deposits of similar moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma involving the peritoneal surface, and with invasion into the underlying adipose tissue.  Associated lymphovascular invasion is noted.  Several similar nodules of metastatic adenocarcinoma are confirmed within the Pouch of Douglas, including peritoneal surface involvement and invasion into the underlying adipose tissue.  Lymphovascular involvement is also noted in this site.

The sessile tumour described within the transverse colon is an area of intramucosal adenocarcinoma arising from an adjacent tubular adenoma.  Sections of the ? anastomosis site show moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with areas of mucinous differentiation, which invades through the full thickness of the colonic wall into pericolic fibroadipose tissue.  The representative section of the mesenteric area of bowel adhesion shows involvement by adenocarcinoma.  There are other foci of adenocarcinoma noted as deposits within the mesentery of the right hemicolectomy.  One ofseven lymph nodes identified from the right hemicolectomy specimen contains metastatic adenocarcinoma, and this metastatic deposit shows areas of signet ring cell change.

826	10248	Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.  
826	10478	Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.  
826	10613	The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.

There is mucinous tumour on the peritoneum measuring 40mm in maximal extent. The splenic capsule has tumour deposits extending into the attached omentum.  On sectioning of the tumour there is a wedge shaped subcapsular haemorrhagic ? infarct measuring 35mm in maximal extent.  There are no tumour masses identified in the spleen parenchyma.  The omentum has diffuse focal areas of tumour deposit. These have been sampled.  The spleenweighs approximately 180g.  Adjacent to the infarct the tumour appears to be invading into the spleen parenchyma. 
828	1594	(4&5 representative spleen with infarct and tumour surface interface; 6 representative omental tumour deposit;7 representative peritoneal tumour deposit; 8 representative spleen).   
828	1776	Peritoneum - There are multiple pieces of peritoneum with attached fat and tissue measuring in aggregate 100x100x100mm. There are extensive mucinous tumour deposits on all pieces. Representative samples have been taken.  There is skeletal muscle attached to some sections.   
828	2051	(9-14 representative peritoneum and tumour deposit) 
828	2103	Right hemicolectomy - A hemicolectomy measuring 210mm in length including 50mm of terminal ileum. The external surface has multiple mucinous deposits along the serosa and mesentery.  On opening the mucosal surface is unremarkable.  There is no appendix present.  Multiple lymphnodes and ? tumour deposits identified in the mesenteric fat.  Apart from the terminal ileum no other small bowel is identified in the bucket.

828	2785	MICROSCOPIC:  (E. Cessor) 
828	2811	Sections of gallbladder show features of chronic cholecystitis and cholesterolosis. Onthe serosal surface of the gallbladder, there are deposits of mucin, one of which contains a strip of mucinous epithelium of low to intermediate nuclear grade. No invasion is seen into the wall of the appendix.  
828	3109	Sections of spleen show some deposits of mucin on the peritoneal surface in an  extracapsular location, with some associated strips of low to intermediate nuclear grade mucinous epithelium within these mucin pools. There are also several pools of mucin immediately underlying the splenic capsule, and containing an occasional strip of mucinous epithelium. A single mucinous gland is seen adjacent to one of these mucin pools, within the fibrous pseudocapsule, but no invasion into the adjacent splenic parenchyma is seen. Elsewhere, the splenic parenchyma shows unremarkable red and white pulp, with no obvious abnormality.  
828	3734	The omentum contains multiple deposits of extracellular mucin, many of which contain strips of mucinous epithelium of low to intermediate nuclear grade.  
828	3888	Representative sections of the peritoneum show multiple deposits of extracellular mucin, many of which contain strips of mucinous epithelium of low to intermediate nuclear grade.  Some of these epithelial strips show pseudostratification and tufting, but no complex papillary or cribriform structures are seen. Focally, a few small single mucinous glands are seen, surrounded by fibrous tissue which in one area is desmoplastic. These few small acinar foci are consistent with focal invasion (mucinous adenocarcinoma).  
828	4408	The margins of resection of the right hemicolectomy show no involvement by tumour. There are multiple deposits of mucin and mucinous tumour epithelium on the serosal surface of the hemicolectomy, together with an occasional isolated gland showing some adjacent desmoplasia, suspicious for focal invasion. No tumourinvolvement of the wall of the small or large bowel is seen. The two lymph nodes identified show no involvement.  
828	4836	Comment: The features present are those of intermediate grade mucinous neoplasm involving the serosal surface ofgallbladder, spleen and right hemicolectomy, with focal subcapsular splenic involvement, and several tiny foci of invasion in the serosa and peritoneal deposits, consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma.

831	3576	Comment: 
831	3585	A binary scheme has been proposed for grading appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei, with all tumours with significant spread beyond right lower quadrant (bona fide pseudomyxoma) termed mucinous carcinoma peritonei (low grade versus high grade). This low/high grade stratification is similar to Ronnett scheme and WHO.  Tumours with intermediate or hybrid features (PMCA-Intermediate -Ronnett) are grouped with low grade tumours in the Bradley scheme in view of similar behaviour in their series, and in a later series (Chua 2012), but less favourable behaviour was described in the earlier Ronnett series for this intermediate group. 
831	4217	This type of tumour would generally but not exclusively be of appendix origin. From the sections available from the previous appendicectomy from 19/12/2060, although there is a small mucosal probable adenomatous lesion present in one of the sections (see separate review), it would be difficult to definitely conclude that this was the primary lesion histologically. The peritoneal mucinous neoplasm epithelium is more eosinophilic and not very similarto the small atypical focus in the appendix. Clinical correlation recommended.

Specimen labelled "Anterior resection" consists of anterior resection comprising a segment of colon, 130mm in length and 46mm in open circumference with attached mesosigmoid up to 75mm in width and 28mm in thickness.  The anterior peritoneal reflection is notidentified.  The serosal surface shows focal fibrous adhesions otherwise appears unremarkable.  There is an ulcerated sub-circumferential firm tumour measuring 48mm in length and 30mm in width predominantly involving the posterolateral wall.  The tumour lies 35mm from the distal resection margin and more than 40mm from the proximal margin.  Further sectioning shows that the tumour to be invading the full thickness of the large bowel and superficially invading the underlying mesocolon.  The tumour is up 12mm in thickness and appears 30mm from posterior/radial soft tissue margin.  No other lesions are identified.

840	1387	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr K Robbins): 
840	1427	Sections of the largest lymph node show extensive involvement by amalignant spindle cell tumour.  A further twenty six (26) nodes were identified in the specimen and these all show non-specific reactive changes only.  The apical node is not involved by spindle cell tumour.  
840	1702	The spindle cells are in haphazard fascicles and have large, pleomorphic nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are frequent, numbering around 20 per 10 HPF, and some abnormal mitoses are noted.  There is a small area of infarct-like necrosis in the node but no other tumour necrosis is seen.  No differentiating features are identified with routine staining.  There is a moderate number of admixed benign small lymphocytes and plasma cells amongst the tumour cells.  There is some residual lymphoid tissue, with hyperplastic follicles, at the periphery of the node.  There is some probable extranodal tumour spread, with a pushing margin (blocks 23, 24) but soft tissue margins appear to be free of tumour.   
840	2417	IMMUNOSTAINS: 
840	2431	S100 - positive. 
840	2448	Melan-A, HMB 45 - negative. 
840	2476	Cytokeratin CAM 5.2, CK AE1/3, CK 5/6, p63 - all negative.  
840	2536	Leukocyte common antigen, CD30, CD20, CD3 - all negative.  
840	2595	Myeloperoxidase, Lysozyme - negative. 
840	2633	CD1A - focal positive.receptor, progesterone receptor - negative. 
840	2699	Smooth muscle actin, Desmin - negative. 
840	2739	Fascin (actin bundling protein) - positive. 
840	2783	CD68 - some patchy positive staining. 
840	2821	CD21, CD23 - highlight residual lymphoid follicles only. 
840	2878	CD34 - negative. 
840	2895	Vimentin - positive.  
840	2917	Ki-67 - moderate proliferation index, around 30%. 
840	2967	The appearances are interpreted as a high grade sarcoma in a lymph node.  It stains S100 and Fascin positive and also shows some patchy CD68 positivity.  I favour this being a primary nodal sarcoma and the immunophenotype fits best with an interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma.  These are very rare tumours which most commonly present with solitary lymph node involvement.  The clinical course is said to be generally aggressive.   
840	3401	I will send the slides to Dr K Magnan, OPERATING THEATRES Pathology, for an opinion and issue a supplementary report.  
840	3520	DIAGNOSIS:   
840	3533	Left axillary tissue:  High grade sarcoma involving one lymph node (1/27), favour interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma. 
840	3655	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:  (21.12.62)      
840	3694	The slides were sent to Dr FAUSTO Kedra, Anatomical Pathology, for review.  He replies as follows: 
840	3793	"The H&E sections supplied are Blocks 17 to 24 from the single largest lymph node which is virtually replaced by a malignant spindle cell tumour. These sections also include 3 separate smaller lymph nodes which show reactive changes and appear uninvolved by malignancy. The tumour is composed of short and intersecting fascicles of spindled cells with occasional small groupings of more epithelioid cells. The tumour cells show considerable nuclear pleomorphism with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, vesicular chromatin and plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm. Occasional tumour giant cells areseen. There are scattered foci of tumour necrosis and there is brisk mitotic activity with occasional atypical mitoses. These cells show both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for S100 protein as well as staining for vimentin, fascin andWT1 (WT1 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SOUTH stain). These cells appear negative for melan-A and HMB45 both on the Devon Energy stains and PATHOLOGYWEST stains. They are also negative on our staining for tyrosinase and MITF1.  Schmorl's stain for melanin is negative. They are also negative for multiple cytokeratins including pan cytokeratin, cytokeratin 19 and the cytokeratins listed in Dr Jamison's report. They are also negative for EMA. The tumour cells appear negative for leukocyte common antigen, CD20, CD3, CD30, PAX-5 and EBV-LMP. They appear negative for histiocytic and dendritic cell markers CD163, CD68, CD1a, langerin, CD21, CD23, CD35, and CD4, which highlight background histiocytic and dendritic cells only. They are negative for smooth muscle markers Desmin and smooth muscle actin. 
840	5413	In the background there is some residual lymphoid cells including occasional reactive follicles, compressed to the periphery of the node. 
840	5551	Overall, I think the most likely diagnosis is metastatic melanoma. I have not had much experience with interdigitating reticulum cell sarcoma as these are rare tumours, but from the literature they are describedas usually having more bland nuclei without necrosis and a lower mitotic rate and they often show variable staining for CD68, lysozyme and CD45. Review of the atypical melanocytic lesion removed from the left arm in 2061 is recommended.If you have access to SOX10 immunoperoxidase, this might prove helpful.  Unfortunately we have only just received a sample of the antibody and have not been able to get it working as yet. Electromicroscopy might also be considered if there is still doubt over the diagnosis after review of the skin lesion. 
840	6305	DIAGNOSIS: 
840	6316	LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE: MALIGNANT SPINDLE CELL TUMOUR FAVOURING METASTATIC MELANOMA". (End of Dr Violette's report).  
840	6436	With the further history obtained that there was an atypical pigmented lesion removed from the left arm in December 2061, I agree that it seems that the diagnosis is most likely to be metastatic malignant melanoma   
840	6652	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (28.12.62): 
840	6685	The slides were referred to Prof K Tuffey, VICTORIAN HEART HOSPITAL Hospital, for review as requested. 
840	6788	He also favours a metastatic spindle cell or desmoplastic melanoma. 
840	6856	The slides were also reviewed at GATTON HOSPITAL by Prof K Cokel and Dr K Sobran.  They also agree that metastatic melanoma is the most likely diagnosis.  They also reviewed the slides of the previousskin excision (KZ-95-13136).  They comment that there are some atypical spindle cells and that it could represent the primary, however they do not think that there is enough evidence for a definite diagnosis on the limited suboptimal material that is available for assessment. 
840	7333	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (17.1.62): 
840	7365	A tissue block was sent to ONCOLOGY (GYNAE)'s Pathology for BRAF mutation detection. 
840	7450	Targeted BRAF mutation analysis on DNA extracted from the block was negative.  No mutation was detected. 
840	7555	Interpretation:  The tumour sample does not carry a known BRAF gene mutation that affects codon 600 of the BRAF protein.  This patient is not expected to benefit from treatment with a BRAF inhibitor based therapy (Chapman et al.  NEJM 2011; 364: 2507-16).

841	119	MACROSCOPIC: 
841	132	Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a piece of liver tissue 120 x 85 x 50mm and weighing 154g.  The convex surface appears to be partially denuded of capsule over an area measuring 80 x 50mm.  The resection margin is inked blue and the capsular surface is inked green.  On the slicing there is a 23 x 22 x 20mm pale indurated nodule abutting the capsular surface and thebare area.  The nodule is 23mm from the resection margin.  The liver away from the nodule appears normal.   
841	622	Blocks:  1 to 4 - representative sections of tumour; 4 - reserve block; 5 - representative section of the resection margin.(SO/mm 11.7.63)  
841	762	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr K Sharr): 
841	800	Sections show a single deposit of a high grade spindle cell tumour showing occasional marked nuclear pleomorphism, abundant mitoses and areas of geographical necrosis.  The tumour cells show strong positive staining with S100 and moderate positive staining with Fascin.  The PanCK, HMB45 and Melan A stains are negative.  The tumour has the same morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile to the previously reported metastatic melanoma within a left axillary lymph node (44D49574).   
841	1298	The tumour lies well clear of the surgical resection margin, however in areas the liver capsule appears denuded with tumour cells extending to this denuded surface.  The surrounding liver shows no significant abnormality.   
841	1522	DIAGNOSIS: 
841	1533	Liver:   
841	1542	-  Metastatic melanoma, size approximately 20mm.   
841	1593	-  Surgical margin well clear.

848	132	MACROSCOPIC: 
848	145	A.  Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a partial hepatectomy measuring 185 x 170 x 70mm and weighing 1176g.  Sequential sectioning shows three distinct tumours measuring 95 x 75 x 75mm, 45 x 40 x 28mm and 7 x 7 x 5mm.  The tumour shows a heterogenous grey tan/brownish cut surfaces with extensive necrosis.  The largest tumour appears 4mm clear of the resection margin.  The other two tumours are well clear of resection margin.  Thebackground liver appears unremarkable.  The two largest tumours abuts the capsule as well.   
848	684	Blocks: 1 - smallest tumour; 2 to 5 - largest tumour (4 & 5 - closest margin); 6 & 7 - second largest tumour;8 - tissue for tumour bank; 9 - non neoplastic liver.   
848	849	Special stains ordered.

849	596	MACROSCOPIC: 
849	609	Patient details checked by JM 
849	639	A.  Specimen labelled "Pleural diaphragmatic mass", consists of a nodular mass   
849	720	100 x 70 x 40mm. The external surface is smooth and shiny with a ragged area at one pole.  The cut surface is solid and firm with a fibrotic appearance.   
849	875	Block 1-5 - representative sections from the lesion; 6 - tumour selected for tissue bank.   
849	967	B.  Specimen labelled "Splenic flexure", consists of a looped piece of colon 270 x 20 x 20mm. The external surface appears covered bymultiple adhesions and there is a dilated area up to 50mm in maximum diameter. The mucosal surface at the level of the dilation appears ischaemic. The rest of the mucosal surface is congested and oedematous.  A nodule is also received, 40 x 25 x 20mm. The external surface is dusky.  On sectioning it has a glistening nodular appearance.   
849	1440	Blocks 1-3 - representative sections from the nodule; 4 & 5- proximal and distal colonic margins; 6 & 7 - representative sections from the dilated and ischaemic colon; 8 - other areas; 9-11 - several ? lymph nodes from the pericolic fat.  
849	1679	C.  Specimen labelled "Retroperitoneal tumour plus left kidney", consists of a large nodular tumour with a piece of dark brown tissue, consistent with atrophic kidney, at one pole.  The tumour is 300 x 150 x 100mm and weighs 1800g.  The external surface is smooth and shiny and is partly covered by adipose tissue.  The external surface appears complete.  The cut surface is fleshy and multinodular with glistening areas and cystic areas filled with mucoid fluid.   
849	2145	Blocks 1-15 - 15 representative sections from the tumour; 16 & 17- representative sections of kidney.  (KZ/ec 30.11.62)  
849	2268	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr D Balcomb) 
849	2308	A.  Sections show a spindle cell tumour of low to moderate cellularity, with some skeletal muscle and a small amount of fat at one edge.  The tumour cells have elongated and plump oval nuclei.  Some of the plump cells are binucleate or multinucleate and have a moderate amount of amphophilic cytoplasm, and these cells often have a single prominent nucleolus.  The cells are haphazardly dispersed in short fascicles within a fibrous stroma.  Mitoses are infrequent and no necrosis is seen.  The tumour abuts the described smooth surface and also extends virtually to the described roughened area at one pole of the specimen (block A5).  In view of the appearances seen in the other specimens (specimens B and C) the features are mostconsistent with a de-differentiated liposarcoma.   
849	3092	B.Sections of the described nodule show that this consists of old, necrotic fat, with surrounding fibrous tissue. There are foci of calcification within the necrotic fat.   
849	3265	Sections of the bowel segment show large intestinal wall.  There is recentischaemic damage to the mucosa.  The wall is unremarkable but, in sections from the described dilated segment, there is atypical spindle cell tumour, of low cellularity, involving subserosal tissue.  No definite tumour is seen in the sections of bowel from the proximal and distal excisionmargins.   
849	3639	Sections from the pericolic fat show mature appearing fat with scattered atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, both within the fat and in septae between fat lobules (blocks B10, B11).  The features are most in keeping with a well differentiated, lipoma-like liposarcoma.  The identification of this component would mean, therefore, that the high grade sarcoma identified in the specimens A and C, and the osteosarcoma identified in the previous resection from 2059, are most consistent with components of a de-differentiated liposarcoma.   
849	4184	The tumourseen in the subserosal tissue of the colon is most consistent with sclerosing variant of well differentiated liposarcoma.   
849	4318	C.  Sections show tumour with a variable appearance.  The majority has features of a high grade sarcoma.  This mainly consists of highly atypical, pleomorphic cells, sometimes with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm, within a loose and myxoid stroma.  With immunostains the atypical cells are strongly vimentin and desmin positive and also show some patchy smooth muscle actin and myogenin positivity.  Stains for CD34 and S100 are negative.  The proliferation index with a Ki-67 stain in the most atypical area is around 50%.  The appearances are of a de-differentiated liposarcoma showing rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation.  Much of the tumour has a lobulated outline but de-differentiated liposarcoma is seen extending to at least one inked excision margin (block C15).     
849	5096	A minor component of well differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma is also identified (blocks C11, C14).  This also appears to extend to at least one excision margin (block C14).  Some tumour comprising hyalinised tissue of low cellularity, with scattered large atypical cells, consistent with sclerosing variant of well differentiated liposarcoma, is also noted (eg. Block C1, C9, C10).         
849	5490	Sectionsof the attached kidney show end stage stages with marked atrophy, hyalinisation of most glomeruli, severe tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis.  There is atypical spindle cell tumour, consistent with de-differentiated liposarcoma, extending to the renal capsule but no definite invasion of the kidney is seen.  
849	5814	Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr D Kun.  
849	5872	DIAGNOSIS:   
849	5885	A.   Pleural diaphragmatic mass:  De-differentiated liposarcoma.   
849	5952	B.   Splenic flexure:  Well differentiated, lipoma-like liposarcoma in pericolic fat, and sclerosing variant of well differentiated liposarcoma in subserosal tissue of colon.

850	389	MACROSCOPIC: 
850	402	Patient details checked by XU 
850	432	Specimen labelled "Subtotalcolectomy" consists of a distal ileum measuring 30mm in length 18mm in diameter, caecum, right colon and transverse colon, together measuring 640mm in length and 30mm in diameter at distal margin and up to 55mm in diameter at caecum.Omentum is present 310 x 200 x up to 10mm and appendix is identified 35 x 6mm.  The specimen has been partly opened on the right colon to a length of 160mm.  260mm from distal resection margin the serosa shows puckering over an underlying tumour.  Sectioning shows a circumferential tumour within the transverse colon which lies 250mm from distal resection margin.  The tumour measures 45mm in length and up to 20mm in thickness.  Part of the tumour has a polypoid appearance comprising 20% of the tumour.  The tumour shows full thickness involvement of the intestinal wall and seems to penetrate the omentum.  There are also multiple polyps proximal and distal to tumour ranging in size between 3mm and 10mm.  The colonic mucosa appears brownish (?melanosis colli).  The mucosal folds are preserved throughout colon but there is focal erythematous areas in right colon (blocks 11 and 12 ?erosion).  The ileocaecal valve, small bowel mucosa andappendix appear unremarkable.  No other lesions are identified.

(KP/ta5/12/62)  
850	2416	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Hodgdon): 
850	2456	Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal transverse colon.  The tumour is almost circumferential and no residual adenoma is identified.  The carcinoma appears obstructive and has resulting in proximal dilatation. There is no evidence of ischaemic mucosal changesproximally and the mucosa of the colon shows a mild/moderate melanosis coli.   
850	2827	The carcinoma has extended through the full thickness of the bowel wall and shows prominent infiltration of the transverse mesocolon. The tumour also shows involvement of the peritoneum where small glands are seen on the surface of the mesothelium and this peritoneal surface (antimesenteric) appears mildly inflamed. 
850	3145	A total of forty-four (44) lymph nodes are identified (nine lymph nodes adjacent to the tumour, twenty-three proximal nodes and twelve distal nodes).  A single node immediately distal to the tumour is largely replaced by metastatic adenocarcinoma with mild perinodalspread.  No other lymph nodes are involved.   
850	3457	The resection includes a total of nine (9) tubular adenomas both proximal and distal to the carcinoma and there is no evidence of metastatic spread tothe attached omentum.  The distal ileum and appendix show no abnormality.

851	2099	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr W Kaldahl)  
851	2140	A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes; the involvement is more prominent of the right side, where the deposit measures 9mm in diameter.  No carcinoma in-situ of the tubal epithelium is identified.There are also microscopic tumour deposits on the serosal surfaces of both fallopian tubes and both ovaries.  There is also focal extension of tumour from the serosa into the cortex of each ovary.  Vascular invasion is identified. 
851	2642	There is a focus of endometriosis within the right fallopian tube wall.   
851	2716	The cervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endometrium displays cystic atrophic features. The myometrium is unremarkable.  There are small foci ofserous carcinoma on, and just beneath, the serosal surface of the anterior uterus.

855	480	Specimen labelled "Right kidney" consists of right kidney measuring 150mm (superior to inferior), 85mm (side to side) and 75mm (anterior to posterior) with perinephric fat up to 20mm in thickness weighing 724g.  A short segmentof proximal ureter is present 60 x 5mm.  Sectioning shows a large circumscribed tumour measuring 105 x 85 x 65mm.  The tumour is present in the mid and lower pole and shows a heterogenous yellow greyish/brownish cut surface.  The tumourappears to abut the renal capsule and pelvis. The hilar soft tissue margin is >10mm clear of the tumour macroscopically. The renal vein and ureteric mucosa appear unremarkable.  No lymph nodes are identified.  The adrenal gland is identified in the superior pole 45 x 5 x 4mm showing no unusual features.  The non-neoplastic kidney shows wedge shape solid pale areas (?infarctions).  The perinephric fat at the inferior aspect shows massive haemorrhage. 
855	1397	Blocks: 1 - ureteric and vascular margins; 2 - pelvis and proximal renal vein; 3 - tumour and pelvis; 4 - anterior tumour; 5 - posterior tumour; 6 - inferior tumour; 7 - tumour with inferior sinus fat andhilar margin; 8 - reserve block for tissue bank; 9 - infarction; 10 - non neoplastic kidney; 11 - adrenal; 12 - perinephric fat with haemorrhage.   (HO/ta 12/7/62)  
855	1766	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Turnbow): 
855	1806	Sections show a renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Fuhrman grade 2.  The tumour is located in the mid and lower pole of the right kidney and measures 105 x 85 x 65mm.  The tumour abuts the renal capsule and renal pelvis but does not infiltrate these structures.  The renal sinus is infiltrated by tumour and the vessels of the renal hilum and kidney contain embolic material.  The preoperative embolisation appears to have little effect on the viability of the tumour but the adjacent uninvolved kidney shows areas of acute cortical infarction.   
855	2357	There is no evidence of tumour invasion of the renal vein or its branches.  The kidney away from the tumour and areas of infarction appears essentially normal and the adrenal gland also shows no abnormality.

861	1935	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Steier):  
861	1975	A.  Sections show a well circumscribed solitary hepatocellular tumour.  The tumour comprises of benign appearing hepatocytes arranged in solid sheets without acinar architecture.  The tumour cells are largerand paler than non-tumour hepatocytes in the surrounding tissue.  No central scars or large arteries are seen.  Focal areas of haemorrhage are present but no necrosis is seen.  Focal areas of fibrosis and septum formation are present.  The tumour is completely excised and is well clear of the resection margin.   
861	2496	The tumour shows a well developed reticulum network (which is confirmed by reticulum stain).  The tumour cells are strongly positive for Hepar-1.  TheKi-67 proliferation index is about 2 to 3%.  CD34 is strongly expressed within the tumour.  The surrounding liver tissue shows macro-steatosis.  There is no significant inflammation.  There is no evidence of architectural change or cirrhosis.  
861	2890	Comment: 
861	2899	Sections show a solitary hepatocellular tumour (35mm), which is difficult to classify.  The overall appearances are favouring those of well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.  The main differentialdiagnosis is hepatocellular adenoma.  Hepatocellular carcinoma usually arises in the background of cirrhosis but no cirrhosis is seen here.  Hepatocellular adenoma is strongly linked to female contraceptive pills/steroids and male cases without linkage to contraceptive pills/steroids are extremely rare.  This case will be sent to Prof Gerald SPANICEK of PROSERPINE HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued. 
861	3530	B.  Sections of gallbladder show features of chronic inflammation.  The cystic duct lymph node shows no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
861	3696	DIAGNOSIS: 
861	3707	A.  Left lobe liverresection - Hepatocellular tumour favouring well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (see text). 
861	3827	B.  Gallbladder - Chronic cholecystitis.  Cholelithiasis. 
861	3885	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (28/1/2062): 
861	3919	Reported by Prof Stefan OTANO, WEE WAA COMMUNITY HOSPITAL Hospital. 
861	3987	I favour a diagnosis of well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, rather than an adenoma, since the lesion has areas with thick trabeculae (>3 cells), focal loss of reticulin fibres, unaccompanied arteries and stromal invasion.  Focally there are a few pseudo glandular structures (dilated bile canaliculi).  Scattered mitotic figures arealso seen.  No vascular invasion is identified.

863	342	Small bowel tumour with mets.   
863	374	MACROSCOPIC: 
863	387	A.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel", consists of one unopened segment of bowel measuring 300mm in length and up to 28mm in diameter.  There is mesentery attached measuring up to 30mm.  There is a contraction in the serosaapproximately 20mm from one end.  The serosal surface is smooth ranging from pale to dusky purple.  On opening the section of bowel there is a tumour present measuring 20mm from one of the ends. It is at the area of stricture of the serosa. The tumour measures 17 x 12mm.  It is pale, firm and fungating.  The remainder of the bowel mucosa is unremarkable. 
863	965	Block 1 - TS surgical margin closest to tumour; 2 - surgical margin of otherend; 3 - LS tumour to margin staples removed; 4-7 - TS tumour (block 6 reserve block); 8 - representative bowel; 9 - representative bowel, LS; 10-16 - lymph nodes/mesenteric fat.   
863	1222	B.  Specimen labelled "Omentum", consistsof one piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 70 x 90 x 25mm. There are tumour deposits on one of the surfaces. The specimen measures in aggregate 35 x 30mm. There are tumour deposits ranging from 3mm up to thelargest measuring 50mm.  It is estimated there is approximately 50% tumour deposit in the omentum specimen.   
863	1581	Block 1 - 3 representative small deposits; 2 & 3- representative sections of largest deposit.  
863	1676	C.  Specimen labelled "Peritoneal nodule", consists of one fibrofatty nodule measuring 12 x 8 x 5mm.  AE 1 block.   (VN/ec  1.12.62)  
863	1810	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr G Bugna):  
863	1849	A.  Sections of small bowel show a tumour which ulcerates overlying epithelium.  The cells are uniform in nature with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei with granular chromatin and small indistinct nucleoli.  The tumourcells show positive staining with CD56 and are negative for CK20 and TTF1.  The features are that of a neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid).  The mitotic count is approximately 6 per 10HPF and the Ki67 is approximately 15%.  The tumour is thus classified as a neuroendocrine tumour G2 (NET G2, WHO 2010 classification).  The tumour extensively infiltrates muscularis propria and extends into subserosal and mesenteric adipose tissue.  No definite peritoneal surface involvement is seen.  Lymphovascular invasion is present.  The tumour lies approximately 20mm from the closest resection margin.  Due to the small amount of attached mesentery, no lymph nodes are identified, however there is extensive infiltration of mesenteric adipose tissue by tumour.  The remaining bowel mucosa shows no significant abnormality.   
863	2891	B.  Sections of omentum show extensive infiltration by neuroendocrine tumour.   
863	2971	C.  Sections show a deposit of neuroendocrine tumour.

870	3549	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene. 
870	3817	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

871	352	CLINICAL: 
871	362	Left upper mass arising from stomach. 
871	400	MACROSCOPIC: 
871	413	Specimen labelled "Abdominal tumour arising from the stomach"consists of a circumscribed nodule 95 x 90 x 90mm with a very small amount of gastric wall attached measuring 28 x 8 x 7mm.  Approximately 80% of the mass shows a peritoneal covering.  Sectioning shows a solid cystic tumour containing haemorrhagic fluid and blood clot.  The cystic component shows a ragged inner surface.  The solid component has a uniform grey-tan cut surface and comprises 10% of the mass.  The solid component is mainly present underneath the mucosal fragment.   
871	957	Blocks:  1 to 9 - representative (block 1 and 3 contain gastric wall); 10 - reserved block.   (ZW/cc  10/1/62)  
871	1071	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr G Taranto - 16.1.2062) 
871	1123	The gastric tumour is a 95mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST expands the subserosal tissue and appears circumscribed with a lobulated, pushing margin. The tumour is moderately cellular and is composed of bland spindled cells arranged in short fascicles with areas of intervening stromal hyalinosis, oedema and very focal necrosis. There is widespread conspicuous paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuolisation. Mitoses are present up to 5 per 50 high power fields. The tumour is 5.5mm from the gastric resection margin and extends close, but does not involve, the overlying serosal surface. The overlying gastric mucosa shows a mild to moderate non-specific chronic gastritis.  
871	1809	Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows: 
871	1883	Tumour cells positive for: CD117, CD34, focal SMA and focal desmin. 
871	1951	Tumour cells negative for: S100.  
871	1985	The Ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights approximately 3-5% of tumour cell nuclei.  
871	2076	COMMENT: 
871	2085	The morphologic and immunohistochemical features areconsistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours between 50 and 100mm in size and with mitotic rate of 5/50hpf, are typically associated with a high risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM).  
871	2438	Please correlate with clinical, radiologic and intra-operative findings. 
871	2513	SUMMARY: 
871	2522	Gastric tumour: 95mm serosal based gastrointestinal stromal tumour, 5.5mm to gastric resection margin (see comment). 
871	2640	***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: Dr G Braget (14.2.2062) 
871	2689	At the request of Professor Witham, this case have been reviewed and a re-assessment of the mitotic count has been performed. Three further mitotic counts (mitoses/50hpf) have been undertaken(on three separate slides) and the results are as follows: 
871	2939	 Block 4: 5 mitoses per 50hpf 
871	2969	 Block 7: 6 mitoses per 50hpf 
871	2999	 Block 9: 5 mitoses per 50 hpf.

872	562	MACROSCOPIC: 
872	575	A.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel" consists of a segment of intact stapled small bowel measuring 535mm in length, 25 to 35mm in diameter with attached mesentery up to 90mm in width and 33mm in thickness.   There are two areas of stricture showing serosal puckering.  The larger area is 170mm from one resection margin and the smaller area is 185mm from the resection margin respectively.  The serosa towards one side of the stricture appears dull and congested with slight dilatation (assumed as proximal part of the specimen).  Macroscopically there is no evidence of perforation.  There are fourteen submucosal tumours ranging from 1mm to 25mm in greatest dimension.  The larger tumours appear to involve submucosa and muscularis propria with atrophic and attenuated overlying mucosa.  The cut surface of all tumours appears solid and yellowish.  The tumours are at least 80mm from the cut ends.  The mesentery appears nodular at the mid aspect which on sectioning corresponds to three enlarged lymph nodes almost entirely replaced by tumour measuring from 10 to 33mm in greatest dimension.  The nodes abut the radial soft tissue margin (inked blue).   
872	1731	Blocks: 1 - cut end (presumably proximal); 2 - opposite end; 3 to 5 - tumours; 6 & 7 - the largest tumour with deepest invasion; 8 - two adjacent tumours closest to cut end; 9 - reserve block; 10 to 12 - each four nodes; 13 to 15 - the largest involved node with margin.   (JQ/Ta 14/1/62)

872	2390	Vascular invasion is present as well as focal perineural invasion. 
872	2457	The tumour cells show mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism aswell as scattered mitoses. The mitotic rate is approximately 1 per 10 hpf. 
872	2594	No necrosis is seen.  
872	2616	 Gland formation, consistent with adenocarcinoid subtype, is present in some of the tumours.  
872	2710	The tumour cells show positive staining with CD56 and Chromogranin. Synaptophysin is focally positive. 
872	2813	According to WHO grading, the degree of nuclear pleomorphism, organoid architecture, low mitotic rate, absence of necrosis and positive neuroendocrine marker expression would be consistent with low grade tumours.  
872	3027	The largest tumour is 25mm in max diameter (macroscopic).  
872	3086	The sections taken from the ends of the specimen appear clear of the tumours. 
872	3164	Multiple lymph node metastases are present, including a large node showing total replacement by carcinoid tumour with extranodal spreadwhich extends to the surface of the specimen (A13 and A14).

873	1811	C.  Sections of the right lung show a 70mm sarcomatoid tumour. The tumour is unencapsulated and predominantly circumscribed. The tumour is composed of malignant spindled to epithelioid cells with moderate to markedly pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and varying amountsof eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumour is moderately to highly cellular and the tumour cells are arranged in sheets within variably prominent myxoid stroma. Mitoses are readily identified. At least 33% of the tumour appears necrotic. Tumour is clear of the pleural surface (2.2mm). The bronchial resection margin appears clear of tumour (10mm). The vascular resection margin shows no involvement by tumour. Three sampledhilar lymph nodes show reactive anthrasilicosis (0/3). The section of non-neoplastic lung shows no significant histologic abnormality.  
873	2641	Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:

873	2965	COMMENT: 
873	2974	The right lung tumour is a 70mm high gradesarcomatoid tumour with myxoid stroma. The tumour shows very focal cytokeratin positivity and TTF-1 is negative. This lung tumour has been compared to thepreviously reported right thigh myxofibrosarcoma (JS-86-790183 5.6.2062). The tumours appear identical and have a similar pattern of immunohistochemical staining, including focal cytokeratin positivity (although the thigh tumour was reported as being cytokeratin negative). Overall, the 70mm lung tumour shows features consistent with metastatic high grade myxofibrosarcoma.

876	588	B.  Specimen labelled "Axillary tissue" consists of a piece of unorientated fatty tissue 40 x 14 x 7mm.  One lymph node 7mm is identified.   AE 1 block.   
876	746	C.  Specimen labelled "Wide medial, short superior, long lateral" consists of an orientated wide local excision measuring 50mm (medial to lateral) x  23mm (inferior to superior) x 45mm (superficial to deep).  Two sutures are insitu as designated and a hook wire is seen to insert from the medial aspect.  The superior margin is inked blue, inferior margin black, deep black and the superficial margin inked green.  The specimen is serially sectioned parasagittally from slice one (lateral) to slice eight (medial).  A cream/tan poorly circumscribed tumour is identified in slices one and two measuring 8mm (medial to lateral) x 6mm (inferior to superior) x 5mm (superficial to deep).  Distance from margins is asfollows:  Superior 7mm, deep 7mm, inferior 6mm, superficial 25mm, well clear of the medial margin and comes close to the lateral margin.

876	1973	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Gilliss): 
876	2013	A.  One (1) lymph node is negative for tumour.  The CAM5.2 keratin stain is negative. 
876	2099	B.  One (1) lymph node is negative for tumour.  The AE1/AE3 keratin stain is negative (some background nuclear staining).  
876	2222	C.  Sections show a 14mm grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma. The carcinoma is present laterally within the specimen and is composed of mild to moderately pleomorphic cells arranged in cords, solid clusters and small tubules. Scattered intracytoplasmic lumen formation is seen.  Although in areas the tumour displays lobular carcinoma-like morphology, including targetoid growth around benign ductules, the E cadherin immunostain is diffusely positive, more consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma.  Invasive carcinoma focally extends to the lateral excision margin superiorly. There are at least five (5) foci of lymphovascular invasion (endothelial lining confirmed with positive expression for D240 and CD31). Unusually, although these foci show similar cytonuclear features to the adjacent stromal invasive tumour they display more distinct tubule formation. Focal minimal calcification is present associated with the invasive tumour.  There is also low to intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in-situ confined within the borders of the invasive tumour.

879	299	CLINICAL: 
879	309	Pancreatic Ca.  Pancreatic body tumour.  Left wrist amyloidosis.  Type II DM.  Bilateral synovitis - knee arthroscopy.  Mitral regurgitation.  HTN.  Ovarian cysts.  Interstitial cystitis.  [1. Distal pancreas.  2. Spleen.  3. Greater omentum]. 
879	553	[Additional clinical history obtained by Dr Tidrick:  The two long sutures are attached to the neck and the short suture is attached to the inferoanterior aspect.  The spleen was initially attached to the specimen but became dislodged.  The specimen includes the left adrenal gland at the superior aspect.  The tumour occluded the splenic vein and was adherent to the portal vein and the superior mesenteric vessels.  The associated fat at the lateral aspect is probable perinephric fat. Patient has finished course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy]. 
879	1099	MACROSCOPIC: 
879	1112	A.  Specimen labelled "Pancreas" consists of an excision of the body/tail of pancreas 95mm(medial-lateral) x 70mm (inferior-superior) x 25mm (superficial-deep).  There are two large sutures attached to the neck while a small suture is attached to the superficial inferior margin.  The pancreatic neck margin is inked green, the anterior margin is inked blue, the posterior margin over the portal vein margin is inked black and the remainder of the posterior margin is inked red.After the neck margin is shaved the cut surface is inked purple.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the parasagittal plane into fifteen slices from slice 1 medial to slice 15 lateral.  A firm cream relatively well-circumscribed tumouris identified in slices 2 to 11.  The tumour measures 36mm (medial-lateral) x 28mm (inferior-superior) x 17mm (superficial-deep).  The distance from margins is as follows: the tumour is 7mm from the medial margin, 5mm from the superior margin, 6mm from the inferior margin, is well clear of the lateral margin but appears to abut the anterior and deep margins.The tumour appears to surround a large blood vessel in the superior portion.   
879	2267	Blocks:  1 - shave of neck margin; 2 - slice 1; 3 - slice 3; 4 & 5 - slice 5; 6 & 7 - slice 6; 8& 9 - slice 8; 10 & 11 - slice 9; 12 - superior portion of slice 10; 13 & 14 - slice 13; 15 & 16 - LS of slice 15 (lateral margin); 17 - reserve block.  Please refer to attached diagram and photographs.

879	2772	C.  Specimenlabelled "Greater omentum" consists of a piece of omentum 240 x 120 x 15mm.  No suspicious areas are identified.  Representative sections in three blocks.   (RR/cc  1/1/62)  
879	2960	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Pitorak):  
879	3001	A.   Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic body. The tumour shows extrapancreatic spread and is associated with an desmoplastic stroma. Tumour is present in slices 3 to 11 (total of 15 parasagittal slices) and has an estimated size of 36mm (medial to lateral) x 28mm (superior to inferior) x 17mm (superficial to deep). There is prominent perineural invasion at the advancing edge but no lymphovascular invasion is seen.  Some of the many peripancreatic nodes identified are involved by direct tumour spread but there is no metastatic spread to peripancreatic and splenic hilar lymph nodes. 
879	3629	Carcinoma is seen 0.1mm from the portal vein bed (margin regarded as positive) and is seen 0.2mm from the adjacent posterior pancreatic margin (regarded as positive). The pancreatic neck margin has an estimated clearance of 8mm (2 slices) and the lateral (splenic margin) appears well clear. Carcinoma is present at the anterior border of the pancreas.   
879	3984	The pancreas shows atrophy of the exocrine pancreas with retained islets and the adrenal gland shows no abnormality. 
879	4101	B.   The spleen and splenic hilum show no abnormality.

883	178	MACROSCOPIC: 
883	191	Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy", consists of a segment of bowel comprising of terminal ileum, caecum and part of ascending colon.  The terminal ileum measures 90mm in length and 35mm in open circumference.  The caecum andascending colon measure 90mm in total length and 40mm in diameter.  The attached mesentery measures 60mm in width.  No appendix is received.  There is a lesion present at the ileocaecal valve measuring 40mm in diameter and involves 80% of the valve circumferentially.  The tumour is 70mm from the proximal margin and is 65m from the distal margin.  There is fat wrapping and retraction on the area overlying the lesion.  The remaining mucosa is unremarkable with no polyps identified.  On sectioning the tumour invades through the full thickness of the muscle wall and invades into the mesenteric fat.  The apical lymph node is not identified.  Multiple lymph nodes are seen in the mesentery.

The cut surface reveals a cream relatively well circumscribed nodule within the fat and abutting and appearing to push into the liver capsule measuring 35 x 35 x 30mm.  The uninvolved liver appears unremarkable.  The tumour appears to come close to the surgical resection margin.   
884	1008	Blocks: 1 to 5 - representative tumour; 6 - uninvolved liver.   
884	1072	B.  Specimen labelled "Peritoneal tumour" consists of seven fragments of tan fatty tissue from 8 to 38mm in maximum dimension.  The two larger pieces are  almost entirely replaced with a cream soft relatively well circumscribed tumour measuring 32mm in maximum dimension.  One of the smaller nodules 18mm is also similarly replaced by tumour.   
884	1417	Blocks: 1 & 2 - representative larger piece; 3 & 4 - second larger piece; 5 - representative smaller piece; 6 - reserve block.     
884	1551	C.  Specimen labelled "Pelvic tumour" consists of four rough and irregular pieces of tan and fatty tissue from 12 to 40mm.  Each piece of tissue has large areas of cream well circumscribed tumour within it up to 12mm in maximum dimension.  Representative sections in 4 blocks.   (RR/ta  2/8/62)  
884	1847	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr R Iannuzzi): 
884	1888	A.  Sections show a well differentiated adenocarcinoma with a villiform and glandular architecture lined by columnar cells.  The tumour shows positive staining with CK7 and CA125.  The CK20, CDX2 and P16 stains are negative.  The morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with an ovarian primary, favoured to be endometrioid in type.  The tumour is situated mainly within adipose tissue adjacent to liver with minorinfiltration of the liver capsule.  No tumour is seen within liver parenchyma and the liver resection margin appears clear of tumour.  Tumour extends to the soft tissue (adipose tissue) margin.   
884	2529	B.  Sections show metastatic adenocarcinoma similar to that seen in specimen A.  The resection margin focally transects the tumour in one of the specimens.

893	568	MACROSCOPIC: 
893	581	Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy" consists of a right hemicolectomy measuring 120mm in length with a section of terminal ileum 40mm.  Starting at the terminal ileum and extending into the caecum 38mm from the proximal resection margin and 62mm from the distal resection margin is apolypoid ulcerated tumour occupying the majority of the caecum with a maximum length of 35mm and width of 30mm.  There is puckering of the peritoneal surface of the caecum at the base of the appendix.  The appendix has a length of 52mm and appears dilated with a maximum external diameter of 17mm.  In the caecum, the tumour appears to invade and abut the serosal surface.  The tumour appears to obstruct the appendiceal orifice but does not invade into the appendix.  One pedunculated polyp is identified, 55mm from the distal resection margin.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.   
893	1480	Blocks:  1 - resection margins; 2 to 4 - representative tumour to deepest point of invasion; 5 - tumour to uninvolved mucosa; 6 - tumour to appendiceal orifice; 7 - tumour abutting the terminal ileum; 8 - polyps; 9 - apical lymph node; 10 & 11 - serial sections of two matted lymphnodes; 12 to 15 - further lymph nodes; 16 - representative appendix; 17 - reserve block.   (ZV/cc  14/2/62)  
893	1872	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Eclarinal):  
893	1915	Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.  The tumour has infiltrated through the full thickness of the bowel wall and involves the serosa.  In one area the serosa is inflamed and haemorrhagic and it is debateable whether tumour cells have breached the serosa.  However in my view this layer has not definitely been breached by tumour (pT3).  The carcinoma also shows early invasion of the mesentery, and abuts the appendiceal orifice and ileocaecal valve. 
893	2402	The appendix shows a small mucocele as a result of adenomatous epithelial lining (cystadenoma) rather than as a result of obstruction. 
893	2537	The right colon contains a single tubular adenoma with mild dysplasia. 
893	2608	Four (4) of the eighteen (18) mesenteric lymph nodes identified contain metastatic carcinoma and one of these shows a focus of perinodal spread.  The apical node is clear. 
893	2780	There is no abnormality of the terminal ileum or colon away from the tumour.

893	3959	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene. 
893	4227	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

The uterus measures 70 x 50 x 35mm and has a dull, congested serosal surface.  There is minimal ectocervix present and the remnant tissue measures 20 x 20mm and appears haemorrhagic.   
897	808	On opening, the endometrium measures less than 1mm in thickness and the myometrium up to 20mm. A 9mm endometrial polyp is present within the posterior fundus.  The myometrium contains fibroids up to 20mm.   
897	1015	The rightfallopian tube measures 50mm in length and up to 5mm in diameter. Multiple parafimbrial cysts up to 3mm are present.  The right ovary measures 28 x 21 x 15mm and has a granular, haemorrhagic serosal surface.On sectioning, the ovary has a nodular cut surface with multiple cysts up to 8mm containing straw-coloured fluid.   
897	1347	The left fallopian tube measures50mm in length and up to 6mm in diameter.  Paratubal cysts up to 4mm are present.  The left ovary is partly solid and partly cystic, measuring 75 x 55 x 40mm.  The outer surface appears predominantly smooth with some adherent omentum and patchy granularity.  Sectioning reveals firm white tumour within the solid areas.  The cystic areas contain yellow gelatinous material.

897	2748	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr L Hirota) 
897	2787	A.  A section of the posterior cervix shows a focus of ulceration and reactive change in the squamous and columnar epithelium.  Focally just beneath the serosal surface of the posterior cervix there is a deposit of serous carcinoma.  The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.   
897	3061	Sections of the endometrium show that this is mainly inactive and there is a benign endometrial polyp.  However there are foci of serous carcinoma in situ in the endometrium.  No myometrial invasion is seen.  No lymphovascularinvasion is seen. There are leiomyomas and there is adenomyosis in the myometrium.  On the serosal surface of the uterus there are scattered foci of high grade serous carcinoma bothanteriorly and posteriorly.   
897	3498	Sections of the left fallopian tube show invasive serous carcinoma at the fimbrial end.  The invasive tumour measures around 6mm in main diameter.There is also carcinoma in situ at the fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes. 
897	3722	Sections of both ovaries show quite extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma on the serosal surfaces but only focally more deeply within the ovaries.  The main described cyst in the left ovary is benign.   
897	3940	A section of the right parametrium shows focal serous carcinoma on the serosal surface. The left parametrium is unremarkable.   
897	4068	B.  Sections show two lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
897	4124	C.  Section shows one lymph node.  No tumour is seen. 
897	4178	D.  Sections of omentum show extensive involvement by moderately differentiated serous carcinoma, mainly in fibrous septae between the fat lobules.   One uninvolved small lymph node is also identified in the omentum.    
897	4398	DIAGNOSIS:   
897	4411	A.   Serous carcinoma at fimbrial end of left fallopian tube and involving serosa of both ovaries, uterus, posterior cervix and right parametrium.  Serous carcinoma in situ atfimbrial end of right tube.  Serous carcinoma in situ of endometrium.  Uterine leiomyomas and adenomyosis. 
897	4693	B.   Right common iliac lymph nodes:  No tumour (0/2). 
897	4748	C.   Right external iliac lymph node:  No tumour (0/1). 
897	4804	D.   Omentum:  Serous carcinoma.  
897	4838	COMMENT: 
897	4847	The features are most consistent with a primary moderately differentiated serous carcinomaof the fimbrial end of the left tube, with metastases in the omentum, on the serosa of both ovaries and on the uterine serosa.  There is also serous carcinoma in situ in the endometrium but it is noted thatthe previous uterine curettings and cervical cone biopsy (44S69897) showed extensive serous carcinoma in the endometrium and serous carcinoma involving cervical glands and stroma.  The endometrial and cervical tumour also seem likely to be metastatic from the left tube.  There is also serous carcinoma in-situ at the fimbrial end of the right tube.  
897	5494	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (28.8.63): 
897	5526	Stains for hormone receptors were requested on this specimen but were instead done on the previous uterine currettings specimen (44S69897O); please see that specimen for result.

898	1960	MICROSCOPIC:(Reported by Dr Z Babson) 
898	1998	A.  Sections are of skin extending to deep subcutis, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. The 35mm tumour is aleiomyosarcoma. The leiomyosarcoma is composed of moderately pleomorphic malignant spindled cells arranged intersecting fascicles, with increased mitotic activity (up to 30 mitoses/10 hpf) and areas of necrosis. The tumour is 2mm from the deep margin and 1.6mm from the peripheral margin. Immunohistochemical stains show typical SMA and desmin positivity, as well as, focal CD10 positivity. A KI-67 highlights up to 95% of tumour cell nuclei. 
898	2560	B.  Sections of the two right external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/2).  
898	2656	C.  The 55mm right iliac fossa mass is a malignant spindle cell tumour. The morphology is similar to the anterior abdominal wall tumour and is consistent with a leiomyosarcoma. The degree of cytologic atypia appears greater within this right iliac fossa tumour. The tumour is partially surrounded by a thin cuff of fibrocollagenous tissue, but focally abuts the inked margin.  
898	3033	D.  Theleft anterior abdominal wall tumour is a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with leiomyosarcoma. The appearance is similar to the previously described abdominal wall and right iliac fossa tumours. The tumour deposit is surrounded by a variably thick rim of fibrocollagenous tissue and is focally less than 0.1mm from the inked margin. 
898	3381	E.  Sections of the small bowel tumour show a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent withleiomyosarcoma. The tumour is largely fragmented and appears focally attached to the outer muscularis mucosa/serosa of the small bowel. The small bowel mucosa and submucosa show no significant histologic abnormality. The tumour is extensively fragmented after processing and accurate assessment of margins is difficult.

899	84	Uterine cancer.  Adenocarcinoma uterus.  Uterine Ca met.  Pt is on aromatase inhibitor clinical trial.  NB a small wedge of tumour was taken from capsule for Dr Fickett's liver tissue bank.  Pt has also consented for MEDIC/SURGERY WARD biobank.   
899	331	MACROSCOPIC: 
899	344	Specimen labelled "Liver resection" consists of a wedge of liver measuring up to 135 x 105 x 45mm and weighing 367.2g post fixation.  There is a tumour measuring 112 x up to 85 x 49mm.  It is adjacent to the capsular surface.  It is lobulated, firm, white to cream with areas of patchy focal haemorrhage and necrosis.  The tumour takes up about 80% of the volumes of the specimen.  The sections of normal liver are unremarkable.  The tumour extends to within 2mm of the posterior surgical margin.  
899	842	Blocks:  1 & 2 - representative normal liver; 3 - tumour with closest deep surgical margin; 4 - reserved block; 5 & 6 - tumour abutting capsular surface; 7 - representative tumour with haemorrhage.  (JS/mm 16.2.62)   
899	1059	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Ruschel): 
899	1099	Sections of liver show metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.   The CK7 stain is focally positive and the CK20 stain is negative consistent with a gynaecological primary.  Extensive necrosis is present, possibly treatment related.  Although grade 1 areas arepresent, focally the tumour shows grade 3 architecture.  The tumour comes to within 1.5mm of the surgical resection margin and abuts the liver capsule but does not breach it.  The adjacent liver shows no significant abnormality. 
899	1618	DIAGNOSIS:   
899	1631	Liver: 
899	1638	-   Metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with endometrioid adenocarcinoma. 
899	1713	-   Excision appears complete.

904	2600	C.  Specimen labelled "Left axillary tail left breast" consists of an unorientated piece of fatty tissue 30 x 30 x 10mm. No suspicious areas or lymph nodes are identified.AE 2 blocks.  (TO: HG; TO/ta  21/2/62)  
904	2814	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Berta):  
904	2853	A-C.  Sections show three separate invasive carcinomas.  The main carcinoma at 1-2 o'clock 45mm FN is a grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 1).  A separate grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 2) is present around the large  subareolar ducts of the nipple and is approximately 30mm from the main carcinoma.  An incidental 2.3mm grade 1 infiltrating tubular carcinoma (tumour 3) is present about 2mm deep to tumour 2.   
904	3293	Paraffin sections of the single sentinel lymph node show a minute cluster of tumour cells with occasional intracytoplasmic lumina within the subcapsular sinus measuring <0.1mm in maximum dimension (detected on an H&E stained section, block A1L2). This particular area has cut out on deeper levels examined with H&E and keratin immunostains, however, in adjacent tissue in the same cross section keratin immunostained sections reveal further dispersed single tumour cells within the subcapsular sinus distributed over an area of 4mm.  The total number of tumour cellsin this cross section, both H&E and keratin immunostain detected number less than 200 cells and is consistent with node involvement by isolated tumour cells of lobular carcinoma.  However in a separate cross section of the sentinel lymph node, keratin immunostains reveal a further minute cluster of cohesive and single tumour cells 0.3mm in dimension as well as dispersed single cells in the subcapsular and medullary sinuses, distributed over an area of 5mm.  While an interpretation of this second separate focus of intranodal tumour cells as isolated tumour cells is possible (the 0.3mm cluster is not strictly a completely cohesive and expansile cluster and the total number of tumour cells in this crosssection number less than 200 cells), I have classified it as a micrometastasis (recognizing overlap in the definition).

906	1502	C.  Specimen labelled "Inferior lateral margin right breast suture on cavity" consists of an irregular piece of fibrofattytissue with a suture on the cavity side measuring 45 x 30 x 5mm.  The cavity side is inked blue and the opposite side is inked black.  The specimen is sectioned from lateral to medial and AE. 
906	1816	Blocks:  1 - most lateral margin; 2 to 5 -serial sections; 6 - most medial margin. 
906	1899	(YO/bl 20/2/62) 
906	1915	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Szopinski): 
906	1957	A.  Five lymph nodes are identified.  All five lymph nodes are involved by metastatic ductal carcinoma.  In four lymphnodes, the metastases are greater than 2mm.  No extranodal spread is seen. 
906	2150	B.  Sections show invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 30mm in diameter.  The invasive carcinoma scores grade 3 (T-2, N-3, M-3).  Possible lymphovascular invasion is present.  There is extensive DCIS within the invasive carcinoma and within adjacent tissue measuring 35mm in diameter.  The DCIS shows high grade nuclei with a mixture of cribriform, solid and micropapillary architecture.  Necrosis and calcification are present.  The tumouris incompletely excised.  The invasive carcinoma is 1mm to the inferior margin (block B8 and B13), is 1.5mm to the superior margin (block B5), is 2mm to the deep margin (block B12) and is 2.5mm to the deep margin (block B9).  The DCISinvolves superior margin (block B5, B7 and B11), lateral margin (block B15 and B16), inferior margin (block B10 and B12), deep margin (block B5) and superficial margin (block B12).  The medial margin is well clear.  The tumour cells are strongly positive for ER and PR.  The stain for HER-2 is negative.  The breast tissue away from the tumour shows fibrocystic change. 
906	3193	C.  The specimen C (inferior lateral margin right breast) shows foci of invasive ductal carcinoma within background of extensive DCIS.  The tumour is incompletely excised.  The invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS extends to the new resection margin over a broad area.

908	3630	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr C Markert)  
908	3671	Sections show a 45mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, NOS located at 3 o'clock 70mm from the nipple.  The tumour is composed of moderately pleomorphic with occasional nucleoli and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged mainly in solid nests with minimal tubule formation within a fibrotic and focally myxoid stroma. There is prominent retraction artefact but numerous foci of definite lymphovascular invasion are seen beyond the tumour margins. The second tumour in the lateral breast at 2 o'clock 80mm from the nipple is a 20mm intramammary lymph node completely replaced by metastatic tumour (block A17) with foci of extranodal extension. It displays identical morphology to the main tumour. Two (2) other intramammary lymph nodes are free of tumour.  Eighteen (18) of twenty (29) nine left axillary lymph nodes contain metastatic carcinoma (specimens B & C) and there are numerous foci of extranodal extension. One inta (sic) pectoral lymph node (specimen D) is completely replaced by tumour withextranodal extension measuring about 5mm into extranodal fat over a front of 7mm and focally invading the adventitial layer of a large vein. No striated muscle is seen around the lymph node. A synoptic report for breast carcinoma follows:

909	663	Poorly differentiated carcinoma. 
909	696	Phone result to gynaecology resident by Dr Q Caughorn at 10.10am on 2/1/13. 
909	772	B.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, left tube + ovary" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary weighing 42g in total.  The uterus measures 70 x 40 x 16mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 18 x 15mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is <1mm in maximum thickness and the myometrium is 9mm in maximum thickness.  The myometrium has a small ?papilloma up to 4mm diameter on the superior-anterior wall.  The left fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 6mm in maximal diameter.  The left ovary measures 25 x 13 x 14mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  There is a partial right fallopian tube present measuring 20mm in length and up to 10mm in maximal diameter.

909	1820	C.  Specimen labelled "Omental biopsy" consists of a piece of omentum measuringup to 65 x 48 x 5mm.  On sectioning, there are no tumour deposits identified. 
909	1977	Blocks:  1 to 3 - representative sections.   (LJ/cc  3/5/63)  
909	2039	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Q Guill): 
909	2077	A.  Sectionsshow a high grade carcinoma arranged in sheets, trabeculae and papillae containing fibrovascular cores, with extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm with pleomorphic nuclei containing coarse chromatin and small nucleoli.  Focally the tumour has a squamoid appearance and no glandular formation is seen.  Abundant mitoses are present.  The tumour lies adjacent and focally adherent to the ovary, which otherwise appears normal.  A section of normal fallopian tube is also identified.  The tumour shows strong positive staining with CK7, CA125 and WT1.  The CK20 and CK5/6 stains are negative. 
909	2737	COMMENT: 
909	2746	Although the tumour cells have very similar morphology that seen in the previously diagnosed high grade urothelial carcinoma (L7 CONSULTING ROOMS: Q11478963), the immunohistochemical profile is different.  The urothelial carcinoma shows positive staining with CK7 and CK20, plus focal staining with CK5/6.  The CA125 stain is negative. 
909	3082	It is thus concluded that the current tumour may not represent a recurrence of urothelial carcinoma, but instead is favoured to represent a poorly differentiated mulleriancarcinoma.  As a normal ovary and fallopian tube are present, the tumour may be of peritoneal origin. 
909	3355	B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive and contains a small benign endometrial polyp.  The myometrium, fallopian tubes and left ovary show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.   
909	3618	C.  Sections of the omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.   
909	3718	This case has been reviewed by Dr Q Ankersen. 
909	3764	DIAGNOSIS: 
909	3775	A - C:  Right pelvic mass, uterus and cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries, omentum: 
909	3859	- Favour poorly differentiated mullerian carcinoma (see comment) 
909	3924	- Possible peritoneal origin 
909	3953	- Omentum negative

909	4157	MSH6  Preserved nuclear staining 
909	4190	Comment: 
909	4199	Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.

912	310	Small bowel resection ?carcinoid tumour.  Cardiac hx, Ht. 
912	368	MACROSCOPIC: 
912	381	Specimen labelled "Small bowel" consists of a portion of bowel 302mm in length and up to 40mm in maximal diameter.  There is a stricture present 42mm from one end.  On opening, the lumen is narrowed by a sessile tumour measuring 16mm wide and 18mm long.  There is a nodule measuring 4mm diameter on the serosal surface located 110mm from the end closest to the tumour.  The mucosa away from the tumour is oedematous but otherwise unremarkable.  
912	826	Blocks:  1 - serosal surface with nodule; 2 - margin distant from tumour; 3 - LS margin close to tumour; 4 - full face tumour with deepest extension; 5 - tumour with normal mucosa away from margin; 6 - tumour with normal mucosa closest to surgical margin; 7 - tumour reserve block if appropriate; 8 & 9 - mesentery with possible lymph nodes. 
912	1168	(HH/cc  9/3/63)  
912	1187	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr C Nahari): 
912	1226	Sections show small intestinal wall with a neuroendocrine tumour.  This consists of nests, trabeculae and cords of cells with medium sized and large, relatively uniform round nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  The nuclei have fine granular chromatin and sometimes a small nucleolus.  Some tumour cells have pink cytoplasmic granules.  The tumour forms occasional small glands.  The mucosal surface of the tumour is ulcerated.  It arises from the mucosa and invades through the muscularis propria with an infiltrative appearance, and into subserosal tissue.  It appears to breach the serosal surface very focally.  The assessment of lymphovascular invasion is difficult because of retraction artefact around the tumour cell nests but there is considered to be some lymphovascular invasion in the bowel wall and also multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the attached mesentery.  No perineural invasion is identified.  Mitoses are infrequent, less than 1 per 10 high power fields, and there is no tumour necrosis.  The proliferation index with a Ki-67 stain is low, estimated at 2%.  With other immunostains the tumour cells stain strongly chromogranin positive and also show some patchy, weaksynaptophysin positivity.   
912	2467	The sections of small bowel elsewhere are unremarkable and the proximal and distal margins are well clear.  The described separate serosal nodule is a focus of scarring and foreign body reaction, possiblyrelated to previous surgery; no tumour is seen in this nodule. 
912	2734	Only two very small lymph nodes were identified in the mesentery despite repeated careful searching and these are both free of tumour.  However mesenteric tumour in vessels is likely to come close to proximal vascular margins in the attached mesentery.     
912	2991	The appearances are of a well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid tumour, WHO grade 1).   
912	3093	DIAGNOSIS:   
912	3106	Small bowel segment:  Well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid tumour, WHO grade 1).  pT4 N0.  Multifocal lymphovascular invasion in mesentery, see text.

913	245	MACROSCOPIC: 
913	258	Specimen labelled "Small bowel" consists of a segment of small bowel measuring 290mm in length.  The specimen is not orientated for proximal or distal ends. 
913	415	There is a thickened area of bowel located 13mm from one margin containing a staple margin which is presumed to represent the previous anastomosis site. No mucosal lesions are identified. A mesenteric nodule is located adjacent to apical suture measuring 35 x 35 x 20mm which does not appear to communicate with the bowel wall. There is a small amount of attached fat received - no definite lymph nodes are identified.   
913	836	Blocks: 1 - margins; 2 & 3 - sections of bowel mucosa adjacent to the anastomosis; 4 to 6 - composite blocks, sections from nodule to bowel mucosa; 7 - reserve block; 8 - representative normal mucosa; 9 & 10 - possible lymph nodes.   (CA/ta 21/8/63)  
913	1087	MICROSCOPIC:(Reported by Dr R Weisman) 
913	1126	Sections through the mesenteric nodule show a 35mm deposit of well differentiated neuroendocrine tumour (carcinoid tumour). The appearance is identical to that of the previously reported small bowel carcinoid tumour (62Y96033). The deposit expands the mesentery and is partially surrounded by a cuff of variably dense fibrous tissue and mesenteric fat. Focally, the tissue overlying the tumour deposit is replaced by inflamed granulation tissue. There are scattered foci of lymphovascular space invasion. One of five sampled lymph nodes show metastatic tumour (1/5). The tumour does not involve the overlying bowel wall. The bowel adjacent to the presumed anastomotic site show mild non-specific mucosal chronic inflammatory change with expansion of the lamina propria and thickened intestinal villi. The bowel wall is viable and there are scattered serosal adhesions, including a focal mild foreign body response to polarisable (?suture) material. The surgical margins appear clear of tumour.

915	2598	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr K Herner):  
915	2638	A.  Sections show parotid tissue with a large deposit of moderately and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, most consistent with a metastasis.  This is presumably originally been to a lymph node but the lymph node has now been almost completely replaced and there is extensive extranodal tumour spread.  Extranodal tumour is present withinthe parotid gland and also in surrounding soft tissue.  There are foci of lymphovascular invasion identified in the tumour, including invasion of one or two small muscular veins.  There are several nerves identified within the tumour but only focal perineural invasion is identified.     
915	3276	Tumour extends extensively to the described irregular grey surface of the specimen (presumed deep margin).  Tumour is also present at oneend margin of the specimen, the presumed superiorend (Blocks 1 to 4).  Tumour is 0.5mm from the described smooth fatty surface of the specimen (presumed superficial surface).  Other margins appearfree of involvement.   
915	3632	Twelve other intraparotid nodes were identified in the specimen and these are all free of tumour. 
915	3730	B.  Sections show fibrofat with small nerves and a small muscular vein.  No lymph nodes are seen.  No tumour is seen.  
915	3849	C. Sections show one lymph node.  No tumour is seen.    
915	3905	D.  Sections show parotid tissue and adjacent fibrofat.  One surface of the tissue (presumed superficial surface) is extensively involved by tumour.  The opposite surface (presumed true deep margin) appears to be involved by tumour focally.  
915	4147	E.  Sections show three lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.  
915	4205	F.  Sections show seventeen lymph nodes.  No tumour is seen.

The stroma is partly fibrous and partly myxoid.  There is an infiltrate of scattered small lymphocytes.There are also some ganglion cells present, mainly at the periphery of the two pieces of tumour tissue.  The ganglion cells are interpreted as being from a pre-existing ganglion rather than an integral part of the tumour.  Many of the spindle cells stain S100 positive.  The appearances are most in keeping with a neurofibroma.  There is no evidence of malignancy.

925	324	Addition information obtained from Dr Trudics: 
925	371	Outside biopsy showed adenocarcinoma in a rectal biopsy (excision not yet performed). 
925	457	MACROSCOPIC: 
925	470	Specimen labelled "Liver resection (right hemi)" consists of a hemihepatectomy with gallbladder attached measuring 155 x 95 x 85mm.  Specimen was received with an incision through the capsule.  Three deposits of cream ill defined tumour are identified all which abut the capsular surface.  Lesion 1 measures 90 x 65 x 65mm and comes to 20mm from the surgical resectionmargin.  Lesion 2 measures 35 x 35 x 33mm and comes to 24mm from the surgical resection margin.  Lesion 3 measures 10 x 10 x 8mm and is well clear of the surgical resection margin.  Each of the lesions has large amounts of necrosis identified within it.  Lesion 1 appears to be situated posteriorly and the tumour is seen to abut the ? bare area. The remainder of the liver appears unremarkable.  The gallbladder measures 80mm in length with a maximal external diameter of40mm.  The serosa appears unremarkable.  The maximum thickness of the wall is 3mm.  The mucosa appears smooth and velvety.  No gallstones are identified.  No cystic duct lymph node is identified. 
925	1506	Blocks:  1 to 3 - lesion 1; 4 & 5 -lesion 2; 6 - lesion 3; 7 - uninvolved liver; 8 - representative gallbladder; 9 - reserved block; 10 to 13 - representative lesion 1 to ? bare area; 14 - lesion 1 including junction of peritonealised and bare area.   (TO: DF; BW/mm 3.12.63)  
925	1783	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr W Poczobut) 
925	1825	Sections show three separate subcapsular deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma ranging from 10mm to 90mm in maximum dimension.  The deposits are predominantly composed of a cribriform or fenestrated arrangement of large malignant glands lined by cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei.  There is  prominent central necrosis within the complex large glands.  A lesser component of smaller malignant tubular glands is also present.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen (some peritumoural retraction artefact and tumour carry over).   
925	2382	The closest deposit is 17mm clear of the surgical resection margin and abuts but does not appear to penetrate the liver capsule at the bare (non-peritonealised) area of the liver (block 14). 
925	2573	Away from the deposits the liver displays a normal lobular architecture.  The portal tracts contain a normal complement of bile ducts, hepatic arteries and hepatic veins and there is no significant portal fibrosis or inflammation.  Apart from minimal patchy macrovascular steatosis the hepatocytes are unremarkable.  An occasional portal Von-Meyenberg complex (bile duct hamartoma) is noted.  The gallbladder is essentially normal.   
925	3007	Immunohistochemistry: 
925	3029	The tumour cells stain as follows: 
925	3064	Positive:  CK20 (patchy minimal), TTF1 (Novocastra clone SPT24 - diffuse strong), CDX2 (diffuse strong). 
925	3169	Negative:  CK7, ER, PR, CA125. 
925	3200	COMMENT: 
925	3209	In the context of a rectal lesion the morphological appearances and diffuse CDX2 immunoexpression are compatible with metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.  However, the presence of minimal patchy positive tumoural CK20 immunostaining and diffusely positive TTF1 immuonstaining is unusual for colorectal carcinoma.  Thelatter finding is more typically seen in lung adenocarcinoma or thyroid carcinomas but positive expression has been reported in a subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas with the TTF1 antibody used in this case (Novocastra SPT24 clone).  Further clinical and radiological correlation is advised. Comparison with the morphological appearances of the rectal biopsy may be helpful. 
925	3901	DIAGNOSIS: 
925	3912	Right hemihepatectomy: 
925	3935	-  Three deposits of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 10 to 90mm in maximum dimension (see comment). 
925	4055	-  17mm clear of surgical resection margin and abutting the bare (non-peritonealised) area of the liver.

The circumferential non peritonealised margin of the rectum is inked blue anteriorly and black posteriorly.  The attached mesenteric fatty tissue measures 190 x 60 x 30mm.  Distally there is a circumferential tumour 42mm in maximum dimension.The tumour is 20mm from the distal new margin (measured after removing the staples) and is well clear of the proximal margin.  The proximal limit of the tumour is 9mm proximal to the peritoneal reflection.  The mucosal surface of thetumour is ulcerated.  The cut surface is indurated.  There are patchy calcifications adjacent to the tumour.  The tumour appears to be extending into perirectal fat.  The cicumferential margins are 10mm (anterior), 18mm (posterior), 20mm (left) and 3mm (right) away.  Anteriorly and attached to the anterior circumferential margin there is a piece of tan solid tissue over a length of 26mm (?posterior wall of vagina).

936	341	MACROSCOPIC: 
936	354	A.  Specimen labelled "Stomach" consists of a total gastrectomy with attached omentum.  The specimen includes distorted distal oesophagus, approximately 25mm in length, greater curve 150mm long and lesser curve 100mm long.  On the external of the antrum anteriorly close to the greater curvature there is an almost totally detached haemorrhagic fatty nodule 30 x 40 x 10mm it is 15mm from the distal margin. The specimen includes a small amount of unremarkable perioesophageal fat, lesser omentum and a portion of greater omentum. 
936	885	The wall of the distal oesophagus and proximal stomach (up to proximal body) is expanded by an exophytic circumscribed tumour 75 x 50 x 40mm. The tumour is lined by intact mucosa with and area of possible ulceration 10 mm in diameter in the oesophagus. The tumour extends into the stomach along the anterior wall and lesser curve. The serosa of the stomach is smooth and shiny and appears uninvolved. The cut surface of the tumour is lobulated, solid andwell circumscribed with fibrous appearance there are no areas of haemorrhage or necrosis.  The mucosal surface surrounding the tumour has a flattened appearance. The rest of the gastric mucosa is homogenous and smooth. Proximal margin isinked blue, distal margin black and proximal serosal surface green.   
936	1646	Blocks: 1 to 3 -closest  proximal margin; 4 - proximal margin; 5 - tumour with normal mucosa; 6 - tumour with  lesser omentum; 7 - tumour; 9 - tumour with flattened surrounding mucosa; 10 and 11 - tumour; 12 - tumour with distal mucosa; 13 - representative fundus; 14 - representative antral; 15 - distal margin; 16 & 17 - representative section of fatty serosal nodule; 18 to 20 - greatest curve lymph nodes; 21 to 23 - lesser curve lymph node; 24 & 25 - representative sections of omentum.

936	2500	(UJ/cc 18/3/63)  
936	2519	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Q Blain):  
936	2558	A.  The 75mm polypoid tumour is a leiomyoma.  The circumscribed unencapsulated tumour straddles the cardio-oesophageal junction.  The tumour expands the wall of the distal oesophagus and extends into the upper stomach along its anterior wall reaching the proximal body.  Within the distal oesophagus the tumour appears to be focally continuous with attenuated muscularis mucosa and pushesinto outer muscularis propria. Within the mucosa and submucosa are univolved and the tumour expands the muscularis propria compartment displacing the native smooth muscle fibres.  The overlying gastro-oesophageal mucosais non-ulcerated, however in the distal oesophagus the surface is depressed and lined by attenuated stratified squamous epithelium showing reactive change, overlying a focus of granulation tissue; the appearances suggest regeneration overa prior ulcer. 
936	3418	The leiomyoma has a lobulated multinodular configuration with a main circumscribed nodule plus a few smaller adjacent nodules.  The tumour is composed of broad fascicles of hypocellular fairly uniform cells with bipolar elongated nuclei, pale chromatin, small nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  An isolated typical mitotic figure is seen (<1/50 hpf) but no cellular areas, significant nuclear pleomorphism or tumour necrosis is seen.  The tumour is 2mm clear of the proximal (oesophageal) resection margin and well clear of the distal (duodenum) resection margin. 
936	3985	Four (4) lesser omental and sixteen (16) greater omental lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy. 
936	4086	Immunohistology: 
936	4103	The tumour cells stain as follows: 
936	4138	Positive:  Desmin (diffuse strong), SMA (diffuse strong). 
936	4196	Negative:  CD117 (minimal background staining and mast cells positive), S100 (minimal non-specific background staining), CD34 (highlights capillaries). 
936	4348	The Ki67 proliferation index is less than 1%. 
936	4394	The oesophageal squamous epithelium shows mild patchy lymphocytic exocytosis and very mild patchy submucosal non-specific chronic inflammation.  No glandular metaplasia, intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia is seen.  There is mild chronic carditis and very mild non-specified gastritis within the gastric body and antrum.  No Helicobacter organisms are seen and no intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia is seen.  The duodenal villi are mostly denuded but the residual mucosa and wall show nosignificant abnormality. 
936	4905	The loosely attached haemorrhagic and nodular portion of adipose tissue described grossly anteriorly near the antrum shows subserosal organising haemorrhage, organising thrombus with vessels, patchy fat necrosis and organising septal fibrosis.  The aetiology is unclear but torsion is a possibility.   
936	5207	There is no evidence of malignancy.  
936	5244	B.Sections show unremarkable small bowel wall including essentially normal mucosa.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  
936	5365	DIAGNOSIS:

942	2097	Comment: The posterior fossa tumour is a metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, favour adenocarcinoma. Melanoma and neuroendocrine markers are negative. PSA and TTF-1 negativity makes prostate and lung primaries unlikely, respectively.  CDX-2 is a marker of intestinal differentiation and can be seen in adenocarcinomas of GI tract, pancreas and biliary origin. CK7 positivity and CK20negativity makes an upper GI primary more likely. Correlation with clinical and radiologic findings is required.

950	509	1) Lesion removed from small bowel; 2) sarcoma removed from pelvic side wall. 
950	587	MACROSCOPIC: 
950	600	A.Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy for sarcoma" consists of a right hemicolectomy measuring 330mm in length with a section of attached terminal ileum 155mm.  The appendix is not present.  Attached to the mesenteric side of the terminal ileum and the right colon are multiple nodules of fatty tissue which are covered with peritoneum.  The piece overlying the terminal ileum measures 70 x 65 x 38mm and is 25mm from the proximal resection margin.  There are multiple nodules on the serosa of the caecum and ascending colon; these are covered by peritoneum and have a smooth surface.  The serosal nodules involve a length of 130mm and extend to a point 55mm from the distal excision margin.  On sectioning, the nodulesconsist of uniform fatty tissue which abut and push into the bowel wall but do not appear to penetrate into or through the muscularis propria.  Multiple diverticula are identified within the colonic mucosa.  One large diverticulum has a firm hard black nodule of impacted faeces within it.  Two possibe lymph nodes are identified within the colonic mesenteric fat.  Two donuts of bowel wall are received separately withthe specimen, measuring 50 and 25mm in maximum dimension. 
950	1799	Blocks:  1 - resection margins; 2 & 3 - representative fatty tumour adherent to terminal ileum; 4 to 7 - representative tumour nodules adherent to right colon; 8 - diverticulum; 9 - representative uninvolved bowel; 10 - nodes; 11 & 12 - representative tumour; 13 - reserved block; 14 - representative one donut; 15 - representative other donut. 
950	2144	B.  Specimen labelled "Small bowel tumour" consists of a small sleeve of bowel wall 22 x 10mm attached to a nodular piece of soft tissue 40 x 30 x 28mm.  The soft tissue has a mainly smooth surface but the surface is focally roughened.  The roughened area is inked black and the remainder of the surface is inked blue.  The cut surface shows fatty and myxoid tissue.  Representative sections in four blocks. 
950	2552	C.  Specimen labelled "Tumour right iliac fossa" consists of a piece of tan and fatty tissue measuring 50 x 25 x 25mm.  Most of the surface is smooth and shiny but there is a focal roughened area.  The cut surface reveals fatty and myxoid tissue.  Representative sections in three blocks.    (RR/cc  27/3/63)  
950	2864	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Barcello):  
950	2906	A.  Sections of the described tumour nodules attached to the serosal aspect of the terminal ileum and right colon show well differentiated liposarcoma.  This is partly lipoma-like and partly sclerosing.  The tumour abuts the muscularis propria of the ileum and colon and it extends through the muscularis propria into the submucosa of thecolon in at least one area (block A4).  There are occasional foci where the tumour shows an increase in cellularity and atypia but no de-differentiation is seen.  Three lymph nodes which were found in the mesenteric fat are unremarkable.  There is a fibrous capsule overlying part of the tumour and a small amount of liver tissue isnoted attached to this capsule in one section (block A12).  Tumour involves subserosal fat at the resection margin of the terminal ileum (block A).  Sections of the two separate donuts show unremarkable small and large intestinal wall.   
950	3814	B.  Sections show liposarcoma with some adjacent small bowel wall.  The tumour is adherent to, and focally invades into, the outer muscularis propria of the small bowel wall.  The tumour is sclerosing-type.  No de-differentiation is seen.   
950	4055	C.  Sections show a nodule of well differentiated sclerosing liposarcoma.  Focally the tumour is moderately cellular and shows more marked atypia (block C3) but no  
950	4220	de-differentiation, with the histologic pattern seen in the previous tumour (59B23808), is seen.   
950	4319	Representative slides have also been viewed by Dr P Brundage. 
950	4382	DIAGNOSIS: 
950	4393	A.  Right hemicolectomy:  Deposits of well differentiated liposarcoma, lipoma-like and sclerosing.   
950	4494	B.  Small bowel tumour:  Well differentiated sclerosing liposarcoma.

951	1523	A.  Sections confirm the presence of two foci of moderately to well differentiated adenocarcinoma, 5mm and 10mm in maximum macroscopic dimension, respectively.  
951	1684	Immunohistochemical stainswere performed and the results are as follows: 
951	1757	Carcinoma cells positive for: CK20, CK19. 
951	1799	Carcinoma cells negative for: CK7, hepar-1, TTF-1, PSA. 
951	1855	The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining would be consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of primary colorectal origin.   
951	2005	The adjacent non-neoplastic liver shows preservation of overall hepatic architecture. The hepatocellular cords areregular and are of normal thickness. The portal tracts are of normal size and show patchy mild chronic inflammation. The portal tract structures, including bile ducts and portal vessels, are normal. There is a mild to moderate increase in stainable iron in the hepatocytes in a diffuse distribution (grade 2 of 4 - Modified Scheuer score). Otherwise, the hepatocytes show mild reactive changes. The lobules contain patchy mild macrovesicular steatosis and scattered foci of mild inflammation. A reticulin and masson's trichrome stain show no significant fibrosis or evidence of cirrhosis. There is no increase in stainable copper. No diPAS positive alpha-1-antitrypsin globules are present. No cytoplasmic viral inclusions are seen.  
951	2853	B.  Sections of gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis.

953	369	CLINICAL: 
953	379	Right renal tumour and large paracaval mass involving right colon.   
953	448	1.  R kidney + attached R colon. 
953	481	2.  Paracaval lymph node. 
953	507	3.  Distal paracaval lymph nodes.  
953	542	(Previous FNA and core biopsy - see 86L98105). 
953	589	MACROSCOPIC: 
953	602	A.  Specimen labelled "Right kidney and attached colon" consists of a kidney with attached perinephric fat and a section of colon.  The kidney measures 110 x 65 x 50mm.  There is a section of renal artery 30mm attached and there is a stump of ureter 15mm in length within the hilar tissue.  The cut surface of the kidney reveals a tan/golden/necrotic tumour measuring 28 x 25 x 22mm.  The tumour abuts the renal capsule and focally is seen to push the renal capsule into the perinephric fat.  The tumour appears to come within 2mm of this perinephric fat resection margin.  The tumour is 30mm from the hilar resection margin.  In the area where the tumour appears to push into the perinephric fat there is an area of fibrous/fat necrosis area within the perirenal fat which is adherent to a section of colon measuring 95mm in length.  No definite tumour is identified within this fibrous adherence.  The remainder of the renal parenchyma also appears unremarkable.  Multiple lymphnodes are identified within the mesenteric fat measuring from 2 to 5mm.  A further area of yellow/cream area is identified within the colonic mesenteric fat measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm ? fat necrosis.  In the same area there is a possible area of diverticulum within the colonic mucosa.   
953	1868	Blocks: 1 - ?ureteric margin; 2 - ?artery margin; 3 - other vascular margins; 4 to 8 - tumour to point of capsular invasion; 9 to 14 - representative areas of tumour to areas of fibrous adhesion; 15 & 16 - uninvolved kidney; 17 - colonic resection margins; 18 & 19 - pericolic lymph nodes; 20 - yellow area within mesentery; 21 & 22 - ?area of diverticulum; 23 - reserve block. 
953	2249	B.  Specimen labelled "Paracaval lymph node" consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 80 x 75 x 40mm which has some fibrofatty tissue attached around the surface.  The cut surface reveals a multinodular tan/haemorrhagic golden tumour taking up the entire specimen.  Representative sections6 blocks.  Block 7 is reserve block. 
953	2578	C.  Specimen labelled "Distal caval lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodesare identified from 2 to 12mm.   
953	2744	Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node bisected.  (RR/ta 27/9/63)  
953	2822	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Bobzien): 
953	2862	A.   Sections show a grade 3 papillary renal cell carcinoma with nucleoli easily identified (x10 objective). The tumour measures 28 x 25 x 22mm and is classified as a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma (the tumour cells have eosinophilic cytoplasm). There is no tumour necrosis.  The tumour invades through the renal capsuleinto perinephric fat and is focally present at the perinephric margin.  There is a fibrous adhesion between the tumour and the segment of colon and this dense fibrous adhesion contains scattered small tumour aggregates (T4 - beyond Gerota's fascia).   
953	3441	The tumour does not invade the renal hilum or pelvicalyceal system and there is no abnormality of the renal vessels or proximal ureter.  The kidney away from the tumour appears normal and one small uninvolved perinephric lymph node is identified. 
953	3688	The segment of colon shows no abnormality and the five small mesenteric lymph nodes identified are free of tumour. There is a focus of fat necrosis and dense fibrosis within the mesentery which also contains an occasional tumour aggregate.  This focus within the mesentery is unrelated to the adhesion between the tumour and the colon.   
953	4026	There is also organising haemorrhage within the perirenal fat consistent with a recent core/FNA.  
953	4124	B.   The large paracaval mass has the appearance of metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma and there is a small amount of residual node at the periphery of the mass.  This mass shows focal perinodal infiltration.   
953	4342	C.   Three (3) of the four (4) distal paracaval lymph nodes identified are partly or totally replaced by metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.  (ec)  
953	4497	DIAGNOSIS: 
953	4508	A.    Right nephrectomy and attached colon:   
953	4554	-      Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 2, Fuhrman grade 3, size 28 x 25 x 22mm.

958	1696	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr R Accetta)  
958	1737	Sections show a large fatty tumour deep to fascia.  At the periphery of the tumour there is evidence of invasion of skeletal muscle focally.  In other areas the tumour appears to have a thin fibrous "capsule".  Much of the tumour consists of mature fatty tissue with areas of fat necrosis.  However focally there are thin fibrousstrands containing large atypical cells with hyperchromatic nuclei.  No convincing lipoblasts are identified.  The margins are difficult to assess but there is minimal surrounding soft tissue and the tumour appears to have been largely "shelled out".

The attached peritoneum shows involvement by low grade pseudomyxoma.  There is some mucin in the lumens of the fallopian tubes. The ovaries and tubes are otherwise unremarkable. 
979	4563	C.  'Gallbladder'. 
979	4582	The gallbladder has some small serosal deposits of acellular mucin.  
979	4651	Comment: 
979	4660	A binary (low/high) grading scheme for pseudomyxoma peritonei of appendix origin,  
979	4743	is recommended by WHO (2010). The current peritoneal tumour deposits show features of low grade pseudomyxoma peritonei, broadly equivalent todisseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM) (Ronnett 2001). Current TNM recommends staging as peritoneal metastasis (pM1a).

990	970	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr D Tela): 
990	1009	A & B.  The sections of brain show sheets of highly atypical epithelial cells associated with abundant necrosis.  Islands of viable tumour cells are present in a perivascular location.  The tumour cells are arranged in solid sheets and there are so areas of pseudoglandular and papillary-like patterns.  There is marked nuclear pleomorphism and abundant mitoses, many of which are atypical.   
990	1402	No intracytoplasmic pigment is identified and no squamous differentiation is seen.   
990	1487	The tumour cells show strong positive staining for CAM 5.2 but are negative for GFAP, consistent with metastatic carcinoma.  There is also positive staining for Keratin 7 and Oestrogen receptor.  Progesterone receptor is negative and the Oestrogen receptor staining is weak and focal.  TTF-1, CEA, Keratin 20 and P63 are all negative.  The P63 stain shows positive nuclear staining in a minority of cells within the tumour.   
990	1913	The histological appearances are consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The presence of Oestrogen receptor staining raises the possibility of origin from breast or female genital tract amongst other sites.  Staining for CA125 and WT1 have been performed and are negative.  The CA125 shows very focal staining of uncertain significance. 
990	2271	The adjacent cerebral tissue shows changes suggestive of Congophilic angiopathy.

993	377	?Melanoma R shoulder.  ?Malignant STT with adjacent satellite or lymphnode.  Excision and posterior neck dissection.   
993	496	MACROSCOPIC: 
993	509	A.  Specimen labelled "Right neck dissection, short stitch level 5, medium stitch level 3, long stitch level 2" consists of an irregular piece of fatty tissue with threesutures for orientation, short suture marking level 5 mid suture, medial suture marking level 3 and a long stitch marking level 2.  Lymph nodes are identified measuring from 1 to 5mm across. 
993	869	Blocks: 1 & 2 - level 2 lymph nodes; 3 & 4 - level 3 lymph nodes; 5 - level 5 lymph node; 6 - level 5 fatty tissue looking for more lymph nodes.    
993	1017	B.  Specimen labelled "Lesionneck, mass suture medial margin, 12 o'clock" consists of a ellipse of skin with one suture for orientation marking the medial margin (12 o'clock) and measures 130mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 80mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 50mm in thickness.  On the surface of the skin there is a nodular area with retracted centre measuring 60 x 30mm.  The rest of the parenchyma is unremarkable.  The deep margin appears to be covered by skeletal muscle.  The 3 o'clock margin is inked blue, the 9 o'clock margin black, deep margin green.  Specimen is serially sectioned from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock into fifteen slices.  Slice one 12 o'clock margin, slice fifteen 6 o'clock margin.  In slices five to nine there is a solid poorly defined white tan lesion measuring 40mm from 12 to 6 o'clock, 40mm from 3 to 9 o'clock and 30mm inmaximum thickness.  Macroscopically all the margins appear clear of tumour.  Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram.  
993	2001	Blocks: 1 - TS of 12 o'clock margin; 2 to 9 - slice seven; 10 to 16 - slice eight; 17 - slice fifteen.    (PG/ta 19/3/64)  
993	2124	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr B Zoutte): 
993	2163	A. Twelve lymph nodes identified show no evidence of metastatic tumour. 
993	2235	B. Sections show skin with prominent solar elastosis excised to the level of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a 40mm malignant dermocutaneous tumour with similar morphology as that seen in the previous excision from Laverty Pathology (labelled 09-YANF 13231 Wyont, B 099051132; see also review report by Dr B Depung 09Y05113). The tumour is composed of sheets and short fascicles of pleomorphic spindled and epithelioid cells as well as malignant multinucleated cellswith bizarre, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures are prominent. The appearance is that of a malignant dermocutaneous tumour with features consistent with a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma shows invasion into underlying skeletal muscle but no connection to the epidermis is seen. No obvious lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified. 
993	3060	Excision appears complete and the excision margins are as follow: 
993	3126	 12 o'clock >10mm 
993	3144	 3 o'clock 8mm 
993	3159	 6 o'clock >10mm 
993	3176	 9 o'clock >10mm 
993	3193	 Deep >10mm 
993	3206	The overlying skin shows a scar in keeping with previous excision. The epidermis appears attenuated in areas with increased numbers of basal melanocytes displaying mild cytologic atypia. However, lentiginous proliferation of these melanocytes is not seen. Subepithelial collections of lymphocytes are focally present but no definite features ofa regressed melanocytic lesion are identified.

993	3908	Reported by Riede, German 6.5.2064 
993	3943	SPECIMEN 
993	3952	Received from the SANDRINGHAM HOSPITAL Hospital MACKAY, 1 block labelled "09Y05113_B4". 
993	4040	PATHOLOGY 
993	4050	Histological Typing: Spindle cell malignancy 
993	4095	The sample was reviewed by apathologist and was considered to have 50% tumour cells within the area selected for analysis. 
993	4218	TEST DESCRIPTION 
993	4235	The sample was analysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]). Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation. This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater. 
993	4681	RESULT NO MUTATION DETECTED 
993	4710	INTERPRETATION 
993	4725	No BRAF mutation was detected at or surrounding codon 600 indicating that this patient will not respond to the current V600E specific BRAF inhibitors. 
993	4876	Comments 
993	4885	BRAF mutations are foundin 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1-2]. V600E specific BRAF inhibitors e.g. vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been developed toinhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients. Trials of these inhibitors have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3,4,5]. The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [6].

See diagram.  (TO:YL/ec 28/9/72) 
file1732	1350	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Fine): 
file1732	1387	Sections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen. 
file1732	2400	The tumour cells show the following immunoprofile: 
file1732	2451	-  Positive:  EMA. 
file1732	2470	-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells). 
file1732	2603	-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK. 
file1732	2710	Nuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained. 
file1732	2753	The Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation. 
file1732	2838	The overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. 
file1732	2962	The cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.

file20430	3884	MICROSCOPIC:  (Dr. O. Frederico) 
file20430	3917	A. Sections show fibrofatty tissue with large nerve bundles and one benign lymph node. 
file20430	4005	B. The biopsy shows a cross section of vas deferens which is attached to a large strip of densely fibromuscular tissue, probably representing a large vessel wall. There is an organising blood clot attached to the inner surface. A segment of large bowel muscularis propria is also attached to the outside of the specimen fibromuscular tissue. 
file20430	4348	C. The surface nodules are zones of diathermied liver capsule. The liver shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis in a centrilobular distribution. The identified lesions are all cavernous haemangiomas with identical features. They show ectatic dilated and interconnected blood channels which are separated by fibrous septa and are lined by a single layer of bland endothelial cells. The lesions are well circumscribed and there are no atypical features. There is no malignancy. 
file20430	4826	D. The bowel wall is unremarkable. The macroscopically described possible polyp is a zone of inspissated mucin mixed with mucosal fragments and cellular debris attached to the mucosal surface. The external surface of the bowel has an adherent strip of dense fibromuscular tissue, probably representing vessel wall, which pushes into the muscularis propria focally. It is associated with surrounding mesenteric fibrosis and it has an adherent organising blood clot. The vessel wall histology is altered by the fibrotic reaction. The blood clot extends into the wall of the bowel.  The mesenteric fat shows foreign body reaction to empty vacuoles and minimal suture material. There are two lymph nodes with no malignancy.

file21189	4135	The appendix is involved in all areas by a low grade mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) forming a cystically dilated appendix mass. The LAMN shows fibrosis of the lamina propria and there is fibrosis and calcification of the appendix wall with lost of normal structures. The wall of the appendix is obliterated by penetrating mucin and neoplastic epithelium. There is extensive organising acellular mucin over the surface of the appendix. In two sections (4, 34), mucinous epithelium extends to the peritoneal surface of the appendix (pT4a). 
file21189	4668	There are numerous deposits of acellular organising mucin involving the surfaces of both fallopian tubes (one fallopian tube is attached to the appendix mass) ,  the surfaces of both  ovaries, the serosal surface of small and large bowel, with similar surface deposits over peritoneal tissue and omentum. The deposits have associated granulation tissue, fibrosis, calcification and in areas there is a foreign body giant cell reaction. The surface acellular mucin does not invade into subsurface tissue. 
file21189	5173	Sampled mesenteric lymph nodes are negative  (8 lymph nodes sampled).

file21297	2243	MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr D Swanger) 
file21297	2273	A. Paraffin sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of low-grade mucinous tumour. The distal appendiceal mucosa is replaced by mucinous epithelium characterised by mildly stratified basal columnar epithelial nuclei, apical cytoplasmic mucin, and flat to low villiform architecture. The mucosa is effaced, and in many areas, the mucinous epithelium rests on fibrotic tissue or muscularis propria. In the initial sections, there is a focal aggregate of organising mucin within the appendiceal fat. There is also focal mucin on the surface of the appendix which is not organising and is interpreted as surface contamination during specimen processing. There are no high-grade cytological or archictectural changes. 
file21297	2991	The remainder of the appendix will be embedded and a further report (including final classification and staging) will follow. 
file21297	3118	B. Sections show high-grade serous carcinoma partially replacing the ovary. The carcinoma is characterised by papillary and solid architecture with slit-like glandular spaces, high nuclear grade and risk mitotic activity. Scattered psammoma bodies are identified. There is focal ovarian surface involvement. There is no identifiable serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC). The fallopian tube includes several cystic Walthard nests. The uninvolved ovarian parenchyma shows no specific pathology. 
file21297	3620	Immunostains to follow. 
file21297	3645	C. Sections show involvement of the fibroadipose tissue by deposits of high-grade serous carcinoma with appearances as described in Specimen B. 
file21297	3790	D. Sections show a lobule of adipose tissue with appearances in keeping with the clinical description of appendix epiploicae. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
file21297	3953	E. Sections show focal involvement of the fatty omental tissue by high-grade serous carcinoma.

file21392	4141	The appendix is involved in all areas by a low grade mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) forming a cystically dilated appendix mass. The LAMN shows fibrosis of the lamina propria and there is fibrosis and calcification of the appendix wall with lost of normal structures. The wall of the appendix is obliterated by penetrating mucin and neoplastic epithelium. There is extensive organising acellular mucin over the surface of the appendix. In two sections (4, 34), mucinous epithelium extends to the peritoneal surface of the appendix (pT4a). 
file21392	4674	There are numerous deposits of acellular organising mucin involving the surfaces of both fallopian tubes (one fallopian tube is attached to the appendix mass) ,  the surfaces of both  ovaries, the serosal surface of small and large bowel, with similar surface deposits over peritoneal tissue and omentum. The deposits have associated granulation tissue, fibrosis, calcification and in areas there is a foreign body giant cell reaction. The surface acellular mucin does not invade into subsurface tissue.

file21392	6924	The AJCC eighth edition now defines M1a as intraperitoneal acellular mucin without identifiable tumor cells in the disseminated peritoneal mucinous deposits. There is limited literature data on the prognostic significance of acellular intraperitoneal mucinous disease The limited literature data suggest that patients with intraperitoneal acellular mucinous disease have a decreased risk of recurrence compared with patients with cellular disease and support the inclusion of a separate M category for intraperitoneal acellular mucinous disease.

file22205	4077	MICROSCOPIC:  Dr F. Sneary cy 
file22205	4108	The appendix is involved in all areas by a low grade mucinous neoplasm (LAMN) forming a cystically dilated appendix mass. The LAMN shows fibrosis of the lamina propria and there is fibrosis and calcification of the appendix wall with lost of normal structures. The wall of the appendix is obliterated by penetrating mucin and neoplastic epithelium. There is extensive organising acellular mucin over the surface of the appendix. In two sections (4, 34), mucinous epithelium extends to the peritoneal surface of the appendix (pT4a). 
file22205	4641	There are numerous deposits of acellular organising mucin involving the surfaces of both fallopian tubes (one fallopian tube is attached to the appendix mass) ,  the surfaces of both  ovaries, the serosal surface of small and large bowel, with similar surface deposits over peritoneal tissue and omentum. The deposits have associated granulation tissue, fibrosis, calcification and in areas there is a foreign body giant cell reaction. The surface acellular mucin does not invade into subsurface tissue. 
file22205	5146	Sampled mesenteric lymph nodes are negative  (8 lymph nodes sampled).

file22205	6879	COMMENT(S): 
file22205	6891	The AJCC eighth edition now defines M1a as intraperitoneal acellular mucin without identifiable tumor cells in the disseminated peritoneal mucinous deposits. There is limited literature data on the prognostic significance of acellular intraperitoneal mucinous disease The limited literature data suggest that patients with intraperitoneal acellular mucinous disease have a decreased risk of recurrence compared with patients with cellular disease and support the inclusion of a separate M category for intraperitoneal acellular mucinous disease.

file22604	3750	The frozen sections were difficult to assess, and not contributory, with the diagnosis at frozen section uncertain. The paraffin sections show a partly solid and partly cystic ovarian epithelial tumour. There are areas with a sex-cord/stromal like growth pattern. The more solid area show endometrioid carcinoma with a dense fibrous stroma. The larger cyst locules have nonspecific appearance mainly mucinous lining. The softer and partly necrotic areas within the mass show poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma with sarcomatous stroma (carcinosarcoma), with focal chondrosarcomatous heterologous differentiation. There is tumour necrosis and there is perivascular sparing of tumour. The epithelial areas and sarcomatous areas both have brisk mitotic activity (50 mitoses /10 hpf).

file23991	3905	Comment:  The large endometrial polyp contains foci of high grade serous carcinoma over the surface of the polyp and adjacent glands with small focal areas of adjacent stromal invasion in the polyp with focal lymphatic vascular invasion. Serous carcinoma is also seen within the adjacent endometrium of the fundus of the uterus where there is very focal early stromal/myometrial invasion (0.5mm, block 6). Serous carcinoma shows positivity for P53, WT1, P16, ER (20% 2-3+).  Additionally within the polyp there is background of a lower grade endometrioid carcinoma with mucinous differentiation, grade 2 which comprises about 75% of the tumour volume, with serous carcinoma about 20%. There is also a small focal area of more solid malignancy with increased mitoses which lies within the polyp and adjacent endometrium of the uterus within a 4mm area (&amp;lt;5% of the tumour, block 9). This small focus retains cytokeratin expression favouring a diagnosis of poorly differentiated/ de-differentiated endometrioid carcinoma.

file26211	134	54 year old female thigh leiomyosarcoma - chemoradiotherapy.  On PET noted to have a small 8mm tail of pancreas lesion confirmed on MR.  ?Metastasis, ?primary pancreatic lesion.  Ca oesophagus. 
file26211	330	MACROSCOPIC: 
file26211	343	Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Subtotal pancreas stitch - anterior lower border of neck of pancreas&amp;quot;, consists of the tail of the pancreas with a  long suture at the bottom of the staple line which denotes the anterior lower border of pancreas, with a staple line that extends from inferior to superior from the suture, with the pancreas measuring 73 x 44 x 21mm. The pancreas has a firm palpable lesion on the anterior aspect which measures 20 x 20mm. The pancreas is attached to the spleen via fatty tissue. The spleen measures 100 x 63 x 36mm, and weighs 111g. There is also attached fatty tissue from the spleen, which measures 420 x 76 x 8mm.  The splenic surface is smooth and shiny.  The stapled pancreatic margin is inked black, the anterior pancreatic surface is inked blue, the posterior pancreatic surface inked red, and the inferior border of the pancreas inked green. The pancreas was serially sectioned from medial to distal into 9 slices. The cut surfaces of the pancreas reveal a pale firm lesion measuring approximately 15mm from (distal to medial) x 9mm from (anterior to posterior) x 9mm (superior to inferior).  The lesion is present in slices three to five and appears closest to the posterior (red inked) margin which is less than 1mm. The entire pancreas has been embedded. 
file26211	1646	Blocks: 1 to 11 - cruciate sections of (medial) cut pancreas margin (slice 1) from inferior to superior (block 1 -  inferior medial margin of pancreas, block 9 - most superior medial margin of pancreas; 10 &amp;amp; 11 - superior peripancreatic adipose and vascular tissue - sequentially embedded); 12 - lymph node close to spleen; 13 to 15 - RS attached fatty tissue from spleen; 16 to 18 - RS spleen; 19 to 22 - serial cruciate sections from superior to inferior of distal pancreas (slice nine); 23 to 29 - sequentially embedded pancreas from slice two to slice eight (medial to distal direction).   Photos taken on macropath.    (TO: NM; NM/ta 20/7/2068) 
file26211	2306	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Fadely): 
file26211	2345	The distal pancreas is entirely embedded and examined.  Within the distal tail of the pancreas there is a 10mm tumour composed of a moderately cellular arrangement of malignant spindle cells.  The spindle cells display predominately moderate but scattered highly pleomorphic forms with hyperchromatic vesicular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.  There are numerous mitoses including atypical forms.  The tumour has a fascicular arrangement arrangement and there are patchy areas of both hyalinisation and necrosis, involving about 20% of the tumour compatible with a treatment response.    The tumour has both an infiltrative as well as pushing border and at focally there is a thin fibrous pseudocapsule.  There are patchy areas of oedema and occasional vessels within the tumour show fibromyxoid intimal change compatible with previous treatment.  Apart from focal PanIN-1, the pancreatic parenchyma is unremarkable.  The tumour cells do not appear to arise from vessel walls.  The tumour is well clear of the pancreatic resection margin and appears confined to the pancreas.  The spleen is unremarkable and uninvolved.  Sixteen lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/16). 
file26211	3533	Immunohistochemistry: 
file26211	3555	In the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows: 
file26211	3640	Positive: SMA, Desmin and P63 (patchy weak) 
file26211	3684	Negative: Myogenin, AE1/AE3, CK5/6,  CD34, EMA, CD117, SOX10, HMB45. 
file26211	3753	The tumour Ki67 proliferation index is approximately 60%. 
file26211	3811	Margins/Surfaces: 
file26211	3829	The tumour is well clear of the pancreatic resection margin.  The tumour is 1.4mm from the posterior pancreatic surface, 3mm from the anterior pancreatic surface and about 9mm from the inferior edge.  No lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion is seen. 
file26211	4089	COMMENT: 
file26211	4098	The morphology and immunoprofile is consistent with leiomyosarcoma.  The history of a soft tissue leiomyosarcoma in the right thigh is noted.  In this context the tumour within the tail of the pancreas is consistent with a metastasis from the that tumour.

It is 100mm from superficial to deep, 64mm medial to lateral and 90mm from 12 o&amp;apos;clock to 6 o&amp;apos;clock (presumed superior to inferior).  The overlying skin is 90mm x 14mm and bears no focal lesions or scars.  The groove for the deep femoral vein is on the 9 o&amp;apos;clock aspect and is inked green, the 3 o&amp;apos;clock half of the margin is inked blue and the 9 o&amp;apos;clock half is inked black.  The suture indicating deep lateral lies on the 3 o&amp;apos;clock side.  Eight horizontal slices from 12 o&amp;apos;clock towards 6 o&amp;apos;clock show a 50 x 39 x 34mm circumscribed and firm lesion at the deep aspect of the specimen which has a pale cut surface with a central area of cystic degeneration and yellow softening and peripheral areas of red and brown discolouration (? haemorrhage).  The central softened areas (?necrosis) form approximately 40% of the cut surface.  The lesion abuts the deep aspect, the deep 3 o&amp;apos;clock (lateral) aspect and the (green inked) femoral vein groove, where there is a lumen consistent with vessel up to 4mm in diameter that appears surrounded by the lesion in some areas.  Perpendicular sections of the 12 o&amp;apos;clock end (slice 1) show the lesion is 5mm from the 12 o&amp;apos;clock soft tissue margin.

file27158	2568	Sections show, at the deep aspect of the specimen, a malignant spindle cell lesion with a relatively circumscribed but unencapsulated border, surrounded by fat and skeletal muscle. Tumour cells focally infiltrate into fibrous tissue between skeletal muscle bundles, particularly in the area of the femoral groove.  There is a central area of hyalinisation and necrosis (estimated to be approximately 40% of the tumour) and a peripheral zone of viable tumour that is composed of foci of small atypical spindle cells arranged in ill-formed fascicles with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei and medium sized nucleoli as well as prominent areas with markedly enlarged and bizarre cells with karyomegaly, smudged chromatin, multinucleation and prominent nucleoli.  These areas are associated with vascular proliferation, red cell extravasation and a mild lymphocytic infiltrate and would be consistent with treatment effect.  In the histologically viable areas there are up to 3 mitoses per 10 high power fields (block 4).  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen, though entrapped nerves are identified in the tumour mass. 
file27158	3699	The tumour is 0.2 mm from the deep aspect over several areas (blocks 5, lateral aspect and 9, central deep) and 0.2 mm from the femoral vein groove (blocks 2 and 8).  A muscular artery near the vein groove is surrounded, but not invaded, by tumour.  This area is 4.5 mm from the 12 o&amp;#8217;clock soft tissue margin and well clear of remaining margins.  The overlying skin is normal. 
file27158	4086	Immunohistochemistry shows the tumour cells are positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for cytokeratins (AE1/AE3 and Cam 5.2).  This profile supports the morphological diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma.

file27263	318	MACROSCOPIC: 
file27263	331	A.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Pancreatodenectomy plus omentum&amp;quot;, consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy, with a separate piece of fatty tissue.  The pancreas measures 66 x 39 x 51mm, and the stomach measures 77mm along the stapled margin x 32 x 35mm.  The duodenum measures 218mm in length x 69mm in circumference.  There is peripancreatic fatty tissue attached to the pancreas measuring 110 x 40 x 20mm.  The separate fatty piece of tissue (omentum) measures 175 x 135 x approximately 30mm.  A wire mesh stent is located in the duodenum but not attached to any structures which measured 62mm in length by a diameter of 12mm.  There are orientating sutures on the pancreas (three denoting uncinate process, two denoting SMA margin, and one denoting the portal vein margin).  The common bile duct margin is not macroscopically discernible, and the fellow for Dr Bursi also could not identify the common bile duct margin.  The stapled stomach margin is inked blue and the distal duodenal margin is inked black.  The gastric and duodenal mucosa appear macroscopically unremarkable.  The pancreatic neck margin measures 22 x 15mm.  The portal vein margin is inked blue, the SMA margin inked red, and the uncinate process inked green, and the anterior and posterior surface of pancreas inked black.  The pancreas is sectioned into 13 horizontal slices from superior (closest to pancreatic neck margin) to inferior.  An ill defined tumour mass is seen within the head of the pancreas measuring approximately 30mm across.  A nick is made to represent the anterior aspect.

file27447	1733	A.  Sections of the pelvic mass show an atypical smooth muscle tumour with a small amount of overlying unremarkable squamous epithelium. The smooth muscle lesion is moderately to highly cellular with patchy moderate cytologic atypia (at low power) and brisk mitotic activity (up to 25 mitoses per 10 hpf). There are also several smooth foci of necrosis with features suggestive, but not definite, for coagulative necrosis. A focus of myxoid stromal change is also seen. Overall, the presence of cytologic atypia and brisk mitotic activity, is consistent with a smooth muscle tumour of uncertain malignant potential. However, given the presence of multiple foci of necrosis (?hyaline ?coagulative), as well as, patchy myxoid stromal change, a leiomyosarcoma cannot be entirely excluded.

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right retroperitoneum and right kidney; Suture short superior, loop renal vessels long lateral double loop deep margin&amp;quot;, consists of a kidney with surrounding retroperitoneal fat and other soft tissue, 230mm superior to inferior x 165mm medial to lateral x 84mm superficial to deep.  Superficial surface inked blue, deep black.  Total specimen weight 1238g.  Specimen received in formalin.  The kidney measures 125mm superior to inferior x 30mm medial to lateral x 45mm superficial to deep.  At the superior pole of the kidney are three subcapsular, unilocular cysts, the largest 30mm diameter. 
file28387	1945	Lateral to the kidney there is a circumscribed pale, cream coloured tumour measuring 65mm superior to inferior x 43mm medial to lateral x 40mm superficial to deep.  The tumour is 10mm from the lateral margin, 120mm from superior margin, 5mm from the inferior margin, 120mm from the medial margin, 3mm from the superficial and 3mm from the deep margin.  The tumour is within the peri-nephric fat and appears to be separate from the renal capsule.  It does not involve the kidney.  The fat immediately surrounding the circumscribed tumour is macroscopically unremarkable but elsewhere in the fat, away from the tumour, there are several circumscribed fatty nodules, up to 20mm diameter.  Two nodules are in the renal hilar region and abut soft tissue margins, and nodules elsewhere also abut excision margins.

file28387	3505	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr S Swindell): 
file28387	3546	A.  Sections show an area of fat necrosis with associated recent fibrosis and infiltration by foamy macrophages.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
file28387	3697	B.  Sections show liver tissue with a surface Von Meyenburg complex (biliary micro hamartoma).  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
file28387	3829	Adjacent liver tissue shows moderate macrovesicular steatosis.  This is non specific.  There is a mild and moderate, patchy infiltrate of lymphocytes and occasional eosinophils in portal tracts. There is no interface hepatitis.  Bile ducts appear normal.  There is mild fibrous expansion of portal tracts but there is no bridging fibrosis.  There is only very focal, mild lobular inflammation and no Mallory&amp;apos;s hyaline is identified.  Central veins are normal. 
file28387	4298	With special stains no alpha-1 antitrypsin globules are seen, there is no increase in stainable iron, a rhodanine stain for copper is negative and an orcein stain for Hepatitis B surface antigen is negative. 
file28387	4506	The mild and moderate chronic inflammatory infiltrate in portal tracts are non-specific, but the presence of eosinophils raises the possibility of a drug reaction. 
file28387	4671	C.  Sections of the described circumscribed tumour mass lateral to the kidney show a high grade spindle cell sarcoma.  This consists of fascicles of spindle cells with pleomorphic, sometimes very large atypical nuclei.  Mitoses are frequent, numbering up to around 18 per ten high power fields.  There are small foci of fat within the tumour.  No heterologous elements are identified.  Much of the high grade tumour is circumscribed but there is some extension into the surrounding tissue and it is considered that high grade sarcoma extends to part of the lateral soft tissue margin focally (block C4). 
file28387	5275	Fat adjacent to the high grade tumour and elsewhere in the specimen, including most or all of the perinephric fat, is abnormal.  This shows features of an atypical lipomatous tumour / well differentiated liposarcoma, comprising mainly mature appearing fat with atypical stromal cells within fibrous septa.  The atypical cells have pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei.  This abnormal low grade tumour is seen surrounding renal vessels at the resection margin and surrounding the ureter at the resection margin.  Atypical lipomatous tumour appears to extend to, or abut, most or all excision margins of the specimen. 
file28387	5892	The atypical lipomatous tumour involves perinephric and other fat which appeared normal macroscopically, as well as the described circumscribed fatty nodules. 
file28387	6051	The appearances overall are of an atypical lipomatous tumour with component of high grade spindle cell sarcoma (dedifferentiated liposarcoma). 
file28387	6194	There is a separate small deposit of spindle cell tumour which is present at the deep excision margin in the inferior part of the specimen (block C10); this is considered to be a separate small focus of dedifferentiation. 
file28387	6416	There is some adrenal cortical tissue at the posterosuperior end of the specimen and this is unremarkable. 
file28387	6523	Sections of the cysts at the superior pole of the kidney show that these are lined by clear cells with low grade nuclei, and groups and cords of similar clear cells within septae between the cysts. Most of the tumour has features of a multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential but there is one more sheet-like solid area of tumour, 3mm diameter, consistent with clear cell renal cell carcinoma of conventional type (block C21).  There is no lymphovascular invasion or spread outside the kidney. 
file28387	7038	Also in the kidney there is a circumscribed papillary tumour with oncocytic features measuring 8mm diameter (block C19).  The tumour cells stain weakly positive for AMACR and also show some positive staining for epithelial membrane antigen but are vimentin negative.  Despite the fact that the tumour is only 8mm diameter the histologic features would be very unusual for a papillary adenoma and are favoured to be those of an oncocytic papillary renal cell carcinoma.  There is limited data about these tumours but there are thought to be low grade with infrequent recurrence or metastasis. 
file28387	7630	Sections of kidney elsewhere show features of mild benign nephrosclerosis but are otherwise unremarkable. 
file28387	7736	The atypical lipomatous tumour extends to just outside the renal capsule but does not involve the kidney itself.  The dedifferentiated high grade component extends close to the renal capsule but does not involve the renal capsule or kidney.

file29494	325	MACROSCOPIC: 
file29494	338	Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Subtotal gastrectomy&amp;quot;, consists of a segment of stomach measuring 100mm at the lesser curvature and 180mm at the greater curvature and measuring 55mm in diameter at the proximal end and 30mm at the distal end.  The proximal margin is inked black and the distal margin inked blue.  There is greater omental fat attached measuring 200 x 190 x 20mm and lesser omental fat measuring 95 x 50 x 10mm.  The serosal surface is smooth and shiny and no areas of puckering or distortion are identified.  The mucosa has preserved rugae in the proximal segment and becomes flattened with a cobblestone appearance within the distal segment over an area measuring 80 x 75mm.  These roughened changes extend to the pyloris and 10mm from the distal resection margin.  Within this area of irregularity there is a firm polyp measuring 8 x 5 x 2mm.  A further polyp is identified within the proximal stomach measuring 3mm in maximum dimension located 10mm from the proximal resection margin.  No mass or invasive lesion is seen on sectioning. Four lymph nodes are identified within the attached fat.

file29589	1929	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Horak): 
file29589	1967	Sections of the pancreas show an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of both large and branched duct types (mixed).  The lesion shows mostly low grade dysplasia with only small areas of intermediate grade dysplasia.  The epithelium is predominantly of gastric type.  The tumour involves the main pancreatic duct within the ampulla and extends into pancreatic parenchyma.  The main group of dilated ducts lies within the uncinate process and measures approximately 20mm across however, small foci are also present within the head of pancreas.  The twenty-one (21) lymph nodes identified show no significant abnormality.  An incidental 1.3mm neuroendocrine microadenoma is identified.

file30453	591	Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right arm lesion stitch short - superior, long - posterior&amp;quot;, consists of an oriented circular excision of skin measuring, 62 x 60 x 25mm.  There are two sutures orienting short - superior, and long - posterior.  The specimen is inked as follows - anterior blue and posterior black.  On the surface of the skin there is a scar with prominent granulation tissue measuring, 20mm in length.  On sectioning there is a well circumscribed firm lesion within the  subcutaneous tissue and extending into the scar measuring, 17 x 15 x 15mm.  The tumour appears well circumscribed with a smooth border.  The margins appear clear and are as follows - 2mm from the posterior margin, 3mm from the anterior margin, and 2mm from the deep margin, well away from the superior and inferior margins.  The tumour also appears to arise from the overlying scar.  The lesion is all embedded.  Please see block diagram.

(TO:JL/rs 21/10/66) 
file30453	1870	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr A Shiminski): 
file30453	1912	The specimen is entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of skin to subcutis with fascia and striated muscle at the deep aspect.  Expanding both the dermis and subcutis is a tumour with multinodular architecture.  Although part of the lesion appears pushing,  the tumour has significant infiltrative component at its periphery.  The tumour is composed of atypical spindle cell within background variable fibrus or myxoid stroma.  Cellularity is variable with moderately cellular areas corresponding to areas of less myxoid stroma, and relatively hypocellular areas associated with myxoid stroma.  Within the latter areas there are occasional curvilinear thin walled vessels.  There is variable nuclear pleomorphism with areas of nuclear enlargement of hyperchromasia admixed with spindle cells which are relatively bland, the latter especially seen at the tumour perimete. difficult.  Mitoses number up to 30 per 10 hpf and there is patchy necrosis. 
file30453	2864	Margins: 
file30453	2873	Assessing margins of clearance is extremely difficult because at its periphery  infiltrative tumour appears to merge with adjacent spindle cell scar tissue.  At the deep aspect the tumour mostly abuts the fascia and not penetrate it, however, focally relatively bland spindle cells, favoured to represent tumour, appear to penetrate the fascia and just reach the deep margin over a front of approximately 0.4mm (block 11).  Radially the tumour appears to extend outwards as thin bands within the plane of the subcutis as does organising scar.  Although apparently petering out towards the margins  and becoming less cellular, the  tumour appears to focally reach both the anterior and posterior radial margins (blocks 10, 12  and 7).  Patchy haemosiderin and neovascularisation is present amongst tumour cells.   Elsewhere along the anterior and posterior margin centrally within the specimen, the tumour appears to extend close to this margin but is probably clear.  Probable hypocellular tumour also reaches the inferior margin (block 16).  The superior margin appears clear by at least 5mm. 
file30453	3967	Selected slides of the margins were seen in consultation with Dr A Lyew who agrees that assessment of clearance is difficult but that the margins  are positive as above. 
file30453	4139	COMMENT: 
file30453	4148	The features are similar to those described in the report of the previous biopsy reviewed by Prof Miss RONCO in which diagnosis of intermediate myxofibrosarcoma was rendered.  The tumour within the biopsy was Vimentin immunoreactive but negative for a broad panel of other immmunomarkers.  The tumour in this excision specimen is grade 3 (FNLCC grade tumour differentiation score 2, mitotic score 3, necrosis score 1, total score =6)

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, cervix, left tube and ovary&amp;quot;, received partly open and in formalin, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube, and left ovary, weighing 60g in total.  The previous opening of the specimen is largely askew of the endometrial cavity, and specimen is significantly distorted.  The uterus measures 60 x 50 x 38mm.  The serosal surface has a patchy, grey/tan/haemorrhagic nodular appearance, with scattered roughened areas.  The ectocervix measures 22 x 20mm and is surrounded by a vaginal cuff measuring up to 22mm in width.  The ectocervix shows no significant abnormality.  The anterior cervical margin is inked blue and the posterior surface cervical margin inked black.  On sectioning, both the uterus and cervix appear widely involved by pale grey tumour which appears to undermine the serosal surface of the uterus and the inked surface of the cervix.  There is possible patchy involvement of the serosal surface.  Distinction between the endometrium and the underlying myometrium is challenging given the apparent extent of involvement by tumour.

file30728	3231	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Kinde): 
file30728	3269	A.  Sections show grade 1endometrioid adenocarcinoma which essentially replaces the endometrium and endocervix.  The extent of the disease is such that the epicentre of the tumour cannot be determined.  A small amount of uninvolved ectocervix is present.   The carcinoma extends through the full thickness of the myometrium reaching 0.1mm from the serosal surface.  No definite tumour is seen on the serosal surface (Block A1).  The tumour invades endocervical- and ectocervical stroma reaching 4.5mm from the anterior vaginal cuff margin and 4.5mm from the posterior vaginal margin (A1 and A7) respectively.  Within the cervix the tumour  invades 20mm through a wall 23mm thick (block A7) while in the lower segment/uterine body it invades 20mm through a wall 20.6mm (block A8).  The tumour is composed of an admixture of endometrioid type glands lined by columnar cells with stratified elongated to round nuclei arranged in tubules or cribriform structures with patchy non-keratinising squamous differentiation (FIGO architecture grade1, nuclear grade 1, overall FIGO grade 1). This component shows variable mucinous differentiation with pathy intracytoplasmic apical mucin vacuoles as well intraluminal mucin.  A minor but significant portion of the tumour comprises smaller tubular/alveolar type mucinous glands  lined by cells with abundant intracytoplasmic mucin and peripheral displaced nuclei.  The two components are admixed and areas of  transition are also seen. Single cell differentiation is not seen.  The mucinous differentiation in both components is highlighted s on dPAS staining.  Focal surface hobnail-like morphology is also seen. There are foci of lymphovascular invasion (block A6) by tumour with mucinous features..  Perineural invasion is not identified. The ectocervical epithelium is completely denuded. The ectocervical epithelium is almost completely denuded; the residual epithelium does not show definite CIN.  The vaginal stratified squamous epithelium does not show evidence of VaIN.

file30728	6194	Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype. 
file30728	6335	COMMENT 2: 
file30728	6346	The features are those of an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with mucinous features and the PAX8 expression is consistent with a primary tumour. Some of the morphology features raise consideration of an endocervical rather than endometrial  primary. The epicentre of the tumour cannot be determined due to its extensive nature, replacing the endometrium and much of the cervix.  An in-situ component is also not identified.   The immunoprofile is conflicting;  the Vimentin negative, almost diffuse P16 expression is more typical of an endocervical primary while the strong diffuse ER (repeat stain pending) is more often seen in an endometrial primary.  Furthermore, this panel may not be reliable in distinguishing endometrial from endocervicial  origin as the tumour shows variant (mucinous) morphology and the panel is more reliable in tumours with classical morphology. Therefore an endometrial primary cannot be excluded.  Further correlation with the clinical features and previous pathology may be beneficial.

The specimen has been previously opened with an anterior sagittal incision from cervix to fundus showing prot ruding tumour from the lumen.  The specimen weighs in total 155g.  The uterus measures up to 60mm from medial to lateral, 90mm from fundus to cervix and 45mm from anterior to posterior. The cervix has a blue discolouration.  It measures  35mm in diameter and appears unremarkable.  The right fallopian tube measures 90mm in length and 7mm in external diameter. The right ovary measures up to 30x15x15mm.  The left fallopian tube measures up to 75mm in length and 7mm in ext ernal diameter and the left ovary measures up to 25x15x8mm.  The serosal surface of the uterus posteriorly shows some irregular pale areas ? tumour (inked red).  On further sectioning there is a pale polypoid tumour which measures up to  60x55x40mm and appears to invade with an irregular margin over 60% of the thickness of the myometrium (myometrial thickness appears to be 15mm at the fundus).  The tumour does not macroscopically extend into the lower uterine and cervi cal segment.  The tumour is centred on the posterior wall and approaches the right and left cornu.  The tumour appears to extend to the red inked serosal surface and the right lateral parametrial region.  On sectioning the ovaries are unr emarkable.

file4096	3876	MICROSCOPIC:tlch  (Dr X Hohm) 
file4096	3906	A.  Sections show high grade serous  endometrial adenocarcinoma.  Carcinoma is characterised by an exophytic polypoid intraluminal component, together with invasive carcinoma which extends through the full thickness of the wall of the uterus to form the posterior serosal sur face over a broad front. There is extensive lymphovascular space invasion, and focal small vessel invasion.  Non tumour endometrium shows atrophic features, and sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the right parametrium  show fragments of tumour within a thin walled vessel (presumed vein).  Sections of the bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable. 
file4096	4563	B.  Sections show unremarkable fragments of omental fat. There is no evidence of  malignancy. 
file4096	4657	C.  Sections show a portion of fat.  There is no lymph node present. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
file4096	4762	D.  The two fragments are somewhat crushed and characterised by focal mild to moderate diatherm y artefact.  Nonetheless, there is a surface proliferation together with infiltration by groups and single atypical cells characterised by pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei with a small to moderate amount of cytoplasm. The appearances are  highly suggestive of involved by serous carcinoma.  Immunstains show that the cells are positive for CK5/6, EMA, WT1, and HBME1 and negative for calretitin. The negative calretinin favours serous carcinoma. The remainder of stains may be  positive in mesothelial proliferations and serous carcinoma. 
file4096	5398	E.  Sections confirm the frozen section diagnosis of involvement of the lymph node by high grade serous carcinoma.  The carcinoma virtually replaces the lymph node w ith focal probable extranodal spread. There is a smaller adjacent benign lymph node.

The attached fallopian tube is 58mm in length x 5mm in diameter and appears unremarkable with the exception of a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  A 3 x 3mm yellow nodule is noted on the serosal surface of the soft tissue between the ovary and fallopian tube.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into 9 slices and shows a relatively well circumscribed 19 x 11 x approximately 20mm pale yellow lesion underlying the puckered serosal region (slices 4 to 8).  The fallopian tube is sectioned transversely into 11 slices and the fimbrial end bisected longitudinally.

file5423	6346	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Soprych): 
file5423	6386	A.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
file5423	7239	B.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen. 
file5423	8253	Immunohistochemistry: 
file5423	8275	In the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows: 
file5423	8360	Positive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2 
file5423	8424	Negative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8. 
file5423	8457	C.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour. 
file5423	8928	D.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.

file5423	10975	Negative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8. 
file5423	11009	E.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable. 
file5423	11633	F.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved. 
file5423	12812	Immunohistochemistry: 
file5423	12834	In the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows: 
file5423	12922	Positive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2 
file5423	12986	Negative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8. 
file5423	13019	In contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative. 
file5423	13195	G.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
file5423	13719	H.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
file5423	14144	I &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated. 
file5423	14346	COMMENT: 
file5423	14355	The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr X Maino who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Rogelio comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.

file5794	5175	MICROSCOPIC:     (Dr Q Campoverde) 
file5794	5210	A. Sections show a reactive lymph node with no evidence of malignancy. 
file5794	5282	B. The appendix is dilated and the mucosa is replaced by hyperplastic mucinous villous epithelium resting on the muscularis mucosa. Mucin tracks through the wall of the appendix onto the serosal surface. There are lakes of mucin towards the serosa which are lined by mucinous and columnar epithelium. The lakes contain a few small nests of low grade epithelial cells with scattered goblet cells. The nuclei are all low grade and and basal and range from small round nuclei to elongated cigar-shaped nuclei. The mucin lakes transect into the serosa of the terminal ileum and involve the serosal surface in this area. The proximal and distal right hemicolectomy resection margins are not involved.  Eight lymph nodes are identified including the apical lymph node which are all negative for malignancy. 
file5794	6084	The stomach antral and body type mucosa shows mild chronic gastritis. The serosa of the stomach shows mucin lakes similar to the right hemicolectomy specimen. These mucin lakes contain occasional nests of low grade epithelial and goblet cells. 
file5794	6329	Mucin lakes are also present tracking into the mesorectum and they are lined by low grade epithelial cells. The closest is 2.5mm clear of the distal resection margin and they abut the radial resection margin, separated from the margin by thin strands of collagenous tissue. The surface of the attached peritoneum also shows similar mucin lakes lined by low grade epithelium. The mucosa of the large bowel is unremarkable.

file5794	6860	The splenic capsule is surrounded by mucin lakes some of which are lined by low grade mucinous epithelium. The spleen parenchyma is unremarkable. The peritoneum shows similar surface mucinous deposits. 
file5794	7063	The omentum is largely replaced by lakes of mucin, some of which contain small islands of mucinous cells and some partly lined by mucinous epithelium. In one slice there is liver parenchyma with the liver capsule involved by mucin lakes. Two lymph nodes are identified in the mesentery which are unremarkable. There are two foci 2.5mm and 2.6mm across (B21, B37) within the omental tissue which show small nests of low grade epithelium surrounded by altered desmoplastic-type stroma which is equivocal for invasion (and may represent stromal reaction to extravasated mucin). 
file5794	7639	There are no high grade epithelial features, no signet ring cells and no invasive malignancy in any of the examined sections. 
file5794	7766	COMMENT: 
file5794	7775	The omentum shows two microscopic foci (2.5mm and 2.6mm) of questionable invasion by low-grade epithelial cells.  These foci are equivocal and may represent true invasion or stromal reaction to extravasated mucin.

file7016	3542	MICROSCOPIC:   (Dr J Crehan) 
file7016	3571	A. Sections show of the macroscopically described polypoid exophytic lesion of the anterior cervix show a Mullerian adenosarcoma. The tumour is characterised by a mixture of benign appearing glands and malignant stroma. The glands are lined by endoecervical and tubal epithelium and characterised by mild architectural irregularities. The glands are surrounded by condensed hypercellular atypical stroma with features in keeping with a sarcomatous component. The sarcomatous component shows variable atypia, with at least some foci showing high-grade features characterised by moderate cellularity and nuclear pleomorphism with a mitotic rate of approximately 7/10 hpf. There is focal rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. There is no evidence of sarcomatous overgrowth. 
file7016	4343	The majority of the adenosarcoma is confined with a polyp. There are two foci favouring invasion of the wall of the cervix, to a maximum 2mm in a cervical wall thickness of 10mm (less than 50% involvement). The adenosarcoma has a maximum horizontal dimension of 20mm. There is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion. There is no evidence of involvement of the endometrium, and the adenosarcoma is well clear of the ectocervical margin and of the serosal surface. Immunostains show that the sarcomatoid component is positive for Desmin, and S100 in the area of rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. The proliferative index (Ki67) is approximately 30%. Stains for Cam 5.2, AE1/AE3, CD31, CD34, CD117 and smooth muscle actin are negative. 
file7016	5086	Sections of the endometrium show secretory phase morphology. A leiomyoma is confirmed. There is no evidence of cellular atypia or of increased mitotic activity. Sections of bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable. The ovaries contain several cystic leutinised follicles. 
file7016	5373	FIGO Stage 1b (FIGO Staging for adenosarcomas). 
file7016	5423	Comment: In Mullerian adenosarcoma, the presence or absence of stromal overgrowth carries prognostic significance. The significance of a high-grade sarcomatous component and of rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation are disputed.

Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma. 
file9042	7230	B.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.

file9042	8415	Negative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8. 
file9042	8448	C.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour. 
file9042	8919	D.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.

file9042	10966	Negative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8. 
file9042	11000	E.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable. 
file9042	11624	F.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved. 
file9042	12803	Immunohistochemistry: 
file9042	12825	In the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:

file9042	12977	Negative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8. 
file9042	13010	In contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative. 
file9042	13186	G.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
file9042	13710	H.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
file9042	14135	I &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated. 
file9042	14337	COMMENT: 
file9042	14346	The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr J Moniot who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Gonzalo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.

file9392	6611	MICROSCOPIC    (Dr. C. Mcgaw) 
file9392	6641	A.  Sections show poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with glandular and signet ring differentiation arising in the region of the ileocaecal valve and extending right through colonic and ileal wall to involve the serosa and free mesothelial surface. The rest of the colonic wall shows no focal abnormality. The tumour shows extensive lymphovascular invasion. No large vein invasion is seen. Seven out of ten lymph nodes examined show metastatic adenocarcinoma. The apical lymph node is not involved by adenocarcinoma. Numerous deposits of extranodal adenocarcinoma are present within  the mesenteric fat. In addition there appears to be extension of the adenocarcinoma to the caecal soft tissue resection margin. The proximal and distal resection margins are clear of any lesions. Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumour shows positive staining with CK 20, CK 7, CDX2 and CEA. 
file9392	7520	B. 
file9392	7523	Sections show disseminated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring and intestinal differentiation involving adipose tissue attached to gallbladder, splenic capsule including involvement of a splenic hilar lymph node, serosa of separately submitted segments of small bowel and colonic segment including colonic wall and submucosa. 
file9392	7868	Metastatic adenocarcinoma is also seen in separately submitted peritoneal fragments, omentum and subcutaneous tissues with overlying unremarkable skin. The gallbladder mucosa and wall show no focal abnormalities. The cystic duct lymph node is unremarkable. The colonic mucosa and small bowel mucosa show no focal abnormality. The splenic parenchyma is unremarkable. 
file9392	8235	Sections through gastric body shows metastatic adenocarcinoma involving adipose tissue attached to serosa without involvement of gastric wall. 
file9392	8379	COMMENT: 
file9392	8388	In view of the large ileocaecal mass, this may represent the primary tumour although the morphology is unusual. Origin from upper GI tract is also possible. Clinicopathological correlation is recommended.
